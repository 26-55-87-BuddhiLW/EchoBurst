### Standardized Tags:
These are the standard tags we'll be using along with a short description. If you want to do a topic that is not included, let us know within the Identification of Polarized Blog Posts Issue (https://github.com/TyJK/EchoBurst/issues/4 ). Once it's been discussed, you can add your own tag to the list below, however we'd rather have lots of data for a few topics than a bit of data for many topics. 

This is a potentially sensitive project as we're dealing with core beliefs. One thing to keep in mind when doing this is that none of this is endorsement of any one view; this project is about encouraging dialogue and a broader media diet. Even if you strongly disagree with a position, and have no intention to change, it is useful to know why the other side believes, if for no other reason than to find common ground from which to try to debate. That's what this data is for, and hopefully if you're interested in this project that's something you can agree with regardless of position. Please try to keep debates ON these topics to a minimum. 

**Note**: It may be worthwhile to 'call' a certain topic or perspective, so that we can minimize repeated entries. Simply put your name under the tag below to call it. <br />

**Climate Change - IsReal**: Broadly believe that climate change is real, but generally also believe it is human caused.<br />
**Climate Change - Skeptic**: Broadly believe that climate change is a hoax, or is not caused by humans and not a threat (eg, planet might be warming, but it's natural) <br />
**Abortion - Pro-life**: Believe life begins at conception and that abortion is immoral and possibly akin to murder<br />
**Abortion - Pro-choice**: Believe a woman has a right to body autonomy, that life does not begin at conception or otherwise believe abortion should be legal and accessible <br />
**Religion - Believers**: Believe in a higher power in the form of a specific deity or deities. This deity is usually a creator god, but may or may not directly intervene in human affairs <br />
**Religion - Non-believers**: Believe that there is no higher power beyond what is observable or provable within the natural world. Can also include agnostics (not certain) <br />
**Vaccines - Pro-vaccination**: Believe vaccinations are not only safe, but a beneficial to individual and group health.  <br />
**Vaccines - Anti-vaccination**: Believe vaccinations are a health hazard and can cause detrimental effects (particularly but not exclusively in children) <br />
**Guns - Pro-gun**: Believe that citizens have the right to own firearms for purposes other than hunting/sport or occupation. Does not have to include support for concealed/open carry <br />
**Guns - Anti-gun**: Believe that citizens should not own firearms for any reason except for hunting/sport or occupational reasons. <br />
**Drug Policy - Criminalization**: Believe that drug use, possession and sale should be illegal and prosecutable. <br />
**Drug Policy - Decriminalization and Legalization**: Believe that drug use and possession should not be prosecutable, and may believe that the sale should be legal and regulated<br />

### Your Mission (should you choose to accept it):

Search the internet for blogs and websites that focus on a single one of these topics, and evaluate if they hold a consistent, detectable opinion. Once you have assessed that the blog/site stays on topic and does not have a diverse set of perspectives (at least in the main posts), add the site or site section home page URL. Repeat as many times as you are able. Once you're done, drop your text file off in the URL Dump folder.

Please direct any additional questions to the relevant issue: https://github.com/TyJK/EchoBurst/issues/4

We know this is a laborious task, and we'll be right there with you, but we'd like to take a moment to say thank you so much.
