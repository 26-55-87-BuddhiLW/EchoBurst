### Who We Hope Will Join
Anyone who is interested in the phenomenon of political pollarization and online echo chambers that has emerged across much of the western world. Maybe you've seen the effects of echo chambers and the pollarization it produces in your Facebook feed, noticed it in yourself or others, or heard about it's impact in the news. If you are interested in finding solutions to this problem, and maybe even in shrugging off your own comfortable blanket of confirmation bias, we would love to hear from you. 

### Should I Contribute?"
Yes! Anyone is welcome, regardless of skill level or time available. If you believe you might have something to add, whether it's code, resources, expertise, contacts or just input in the discussions, please contribute. We certainly are in need of some specific expertise; but even if you don't have that expertise, only the interest, don't let that desusade you from getting involved. We're all learning as we go, hoping to make the find the best solution to this problem that we can.
