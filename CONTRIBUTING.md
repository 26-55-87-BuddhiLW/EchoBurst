# Contributing to EchoBurst

### Before You Get Started
All contributors must read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/TyJK/EchoBurst/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing. You can also view our [Roadmap](https://github.com/TyJK/EchoBurst/issues/2) to get an idea of where we are within the project, and what we are looking for at this time. 

### Who We Hope Will Join
Anyone who is interested in the phenomenon of political polarization, online echo chambers and fake/misleading news that has emerged across much of the online media space. Maybe you've seen the effects of echo chambers and the polarization it produces in your Facebook feed, noticed it in yourself or others, or heard about its impact in the news. If you're interested in finding solutions to this problem, and maybe even in shrugging off your own comfortable blanket of confirmation bias, we would love to hear from you.

### Should I Contribute?"
Yes! Anyone is welcome, regardless of skill level or time available. If you believe you might have something to add, whether it's code, resources, expertise, contacts or just input in the discussions, please contribute. We certainly are in need of some specific expertise; but even if you don't have that expertise, only the interest, don't let that dissuade you from getting involved. We're all learning as we go, hoping to make the find the best solution to this problem that we can. 

### Expertise We Need
If you have prior expertise or knowledge in the following fields, you might be a particularly good fit for this project:  

* Machine Learning (particularly NLP)
* Cognitive Biases and Belief Perseverance
* Web development, particularly for browser extentions
* ML integration into web platforms

However, as stated before, these are not prerequisites, simply areas of expertise that are well suited for the present project.

### How Can I Contribute?
There are a few main ways to contribute: 
* Add your perspective to the project by opening an issue or otherwise adding to the discussion.
* Contribute resources that might be especially useful to the project
* Code. We are still in the preliminary stages and will have code that can be added to or modified shortly
