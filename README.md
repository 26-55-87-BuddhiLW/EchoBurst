### Welcome
Thank you for visiting the EchoBurst repository. This README details the broad goals and objectives of the project, and will be updated as those objectives are met to better reflect the current state of the project.  

### The Revival
After two years of hiatus, I finally feel I have the time, experience/skills and the data to make a real run at this project. The repo will be incrementally updated over the next month or so until summer hits and I hopefully have time to dedicate to the project. These updates will help the repo better reflect the new and more fleshed out vision for the project. 

### The Problem
In daysâ€™ past, we had limited choices in what media we consumed and who we interacted with. This limited reach forced us to be less selective: we would talk to those who were closest, watch the channels we could afford and read the papers printed in our area. With the dawn of the internet, many hoped that we would see an expansion in how many views a person had access to, but we have found the opposite to be the case. Since we can now choose from a functionally unlimited number of perspectives, we can customize who and what we interact with to fit whatever view we already had, creating echo chambers of unparalleled fortitude. More than just isolating us, this bias makes it easy to accept fake or misleading stories that align with our established worldview. It has become increasingly important that these sorts of stories and viewpoints divorced from reality are fact checked against a diverse set of established sources. 

### Our Solution
This problem is too large to be solved by any one effort, but we hope to contribute in some small part. The way we hope to do this is by creating a tool that works against the paradigm created by social media of increasingly isolated echo chambers and growing distrust and animosity towards those who dissent against our established beliefs. As explained in the project description, we hope to do this by making it easier to find comments that promote civil discussion (i.e., are not simply toxic, but contribute to the conversation) but oppose the view of the user. In this way, we hope that users will be able to expand their horizons without having to sift through hundreds of destructive and potentially hateful comments to find them. Additionally, to prevent false equivilence between all positions and stories, this will be coupled with NLP enabled fact checking and fake news detection. This process will rely on a wide range of established news stories, and we'll be working to ensure that this process is and remains transparent and as loyal only to the truth as much as we're able. 

### Why It Matters
In an age where political and scientific discourse can literally reshape the face of the planet, our unwillingness to communicate with those we disagree with has caused views to polarize at an exponential rate, and discussion has broken down. If we isolate ourselves from everyone who disagrees with us, we greatly reduce our collective ability to effect change. It is the thesis of this project that most people generally want the same thing: a better, healthier and safer world. Many times, we simply differ on how we believe this can be accomplished. Even in cases where prejudice and distrust infect our discourse, exposure and interaction between hostile groups often leads to the discovery 

### How To Contribute
For details of how to contribute, please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TyJK/EchoBurst/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page. This will be updated to better reflect the new direction of the project, which will focus less on data collection contributions and more on the NLP modules and how these moduels can be effectively integrated into a web extention. 

### [Roadmap](https://github.com/TyJK/EchoBurst/issues/2)
Our stated objectives have been posted in the Roadmap issue, where they can be discussed, checked off and modified as progress is made.
This too will be updated to reflect the new targets of the project, but will likely remain fairly empty until May, when focus can be given to the project. 

### [Wiki](https://github.com/TyJK/EchoBurst/wiki)
The wiki has been updated and now contains an outline of the new structure of the project, the different planned machine learning components, and a very rough outline of the desired stages of development.
