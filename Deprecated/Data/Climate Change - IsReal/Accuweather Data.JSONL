President Trump said that this order will spur not only domestic energy independence but also energy dominance. In addition to recently approving the Keystone XL pipeline, the new order by President Trump does the following, according to the UPI: 1. Reviews Obama's Clean Power Plan. 2. Lifts a short-term ban on leasing federal land for coal production. 3. Lifts limits on coal production. 4. Returns energy production authority to the states. \"The action I'm taking eliminates federal overreach, restores economic freedom and allows our workers to thrive, compete and succeed on a level playing field for the first time in a long time,\" said President Trump. According to the IPCC, there is greater than 90 percent certainty that emissions of heat-trapping gases from human activities have caused \"most\" of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century. Image courtesy the IPCC and Union of Concerned Scientists. Carbon dioxide emissions from coal combustion represented nearly 25 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2012. Image courtesy the IPCC and Union of Concerned Scientists. Obama's Clean Power Plan, which is currently frozen by a Supreme Court injunction, would have attempted to do the following: 1. Cut carbon emissions by 32 percent of their 2005 baseline by 2030. 2. Close hundreds of coal plants and replace them with renewable energy-producing facilities. To no surprise, there was plenty of reaction to the President's executive order. \"We don't import coal.\" Harvard University energy economist Robert Stavins said. \"So in terms of the Clean Power Plan, this has nothing to do with so-called energy independence whatsoever.\" \"Even if we saw an increase in coal production, we could see a decrease in coal jobs.\" said Wyoming energy economist Robert Godby. The reason for this is that coal-powered facilities are using more unmanned equipment today than at any time in the past. Former Vice President Al Gore also responded to the Trump executive order..... “Today’s executive order, directing the Environmental Protection Agency to begin rolling back environmental protections and policies including the Clean Power Plan, is a misguided step away from a sustainable, carbon-free future for ourselves and generations to come. It is essential, not only to our planet, but also to our economic future, that the United States continues to serve as a global leader in solving the climate crisis by transitioning to clean energy, a transition that will continue to gain speed due to the increasing competitiveness of solar and wind. No matter how discouraging this executive order may be, we must, we can, and we will solve the climate crisis. No one man or group can stop the encouraging and escalating momentum we are experiencing in the fight to protect our planet.” Experts believe that if Trump's environmental agenda does succeed it will be nearly impossible for the U.S. to meet the clean air requirements laid out in the 2015 Paris Pact, which the U.S. was a co-signer.

Images courtesy the NSIDC. On the other side of the planet, the Antarctic had its lowest sea ice extent on record at the end of their summer. This is actually surprising to scientists due to the fact that there has actually been a moderate expansion of sea ice in the Antarctic over the past few decades. Combining the Arctic and Antarctic, the global sea ice extent was at its lowest point since satellites started recording the data back in 1979. The difference between this year's combined extent and the average global minimum extent for the 1981-2010 period was equivalent (2 million sq/km) to losing a chunk of sea ice that is larger than the country of Mexico. One reason for this new record-low maximum in the Arctic was explained by Walt Meier, who is a sea ice scientist from NASA Goddard..... “We started from a low September minimum extent. There was a lot of open ocean water and we saw periods of very slow ice growth in late October and into November, because the water had a lot of accumulated heat that had to be dissipated before ice could grow. The ice formation got a late start and everything lagged behind – it was hard for the sea ice cover to catch up.” This year’s record low sea ice maximum extent might not necessarily lead to a new record low summertime minimum extent, since weather has a great impact on the melt season’s outcome, Meier said. “But it’s guaranteed to be below normal.” (NASA) The annual Arctic sea ice maximum extent has dropped by an average of 2.8 percent per decade since 1979. However, the minimum extent in the summer has dropped an average of 13.5 percent per decade. The thinning of the sea ice makes it much more susceptible to completely melting during the summer months as ocean waters, winds and higher temperatures take their toll. It is too early to tell if this year marks a shift in the behavior of Antarctic sea ice, according to Meier. “It is tempting to say that the record low we are seeing this year is global warming finally catching up with Antarctica,” Meier said. “However, this might just be an extreme case of pushing the envelope of year-to-year variability. We’ll need to have several more years of data to be able to say there has been a significant change in the trend.” --- For more details on this year's sea ice extent be sure to check out the NASA report.

Key excerpt from the UAF report... In the Arctic, warmer and denser water from the Atlantic has normally remained beneath a colder and lighter surface layer. The greater the difference in density between the layers, the less likely they are to mix. Without mixing, the heat from the warmer water can’t come into contact with sea ice at the surface. However, buoy data collected by Igor Polyakov, a professor at UAF's International Arctic Research Center and College of Natural Science and Mathematics showed increased mixing in the eastern European Basin, which is a major pathway for Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean. This increase in mixing is allowing more heat to be transferred to the Arctic sea ice that is floating on the surface. This study was recently published in the journal Science.

El Nino typically has a warming influence on the global temperature while La Nina has a cooling influence. Some climate change skeptics like to blame El Nino on the recent period of record-breaking warmth. While El Nino clearly played a role in the warmth of 2015 and 2016, it cannot explain most of the warmth that we have seen. Deke Arndt from NOAA recently put together an outstanding video showing the influences of El Nino and La Nina events on global temperature going back 37 years. We can clearly see that El Nino years are typically warmer than neutral years, while La Nina years are generally cooler than neutral years. However, what really sticks out is the fact there is a clear warming trend over the 30+ years of years where there was an El Nino or a La Nina. Why is that?

Below is the most recent plot of sea ice extent in both the Arctic and Antarctic compared to the 1981-2010 average. FYI: The 2012 plot on the Arctic sea ice graph was the year of the record low sea ice minimum. Sea ice is frozen ocean water. When it melts, it does not add to the sea level. Icebergs, glaciers and ice shelves float in the ocean but originate on land. When they melt, they contribute to sea level rise. Around 80 percent of the sunlight that strikes the surface of sea ice is reflected back into space. When sea ice melts it exposes the darker, colored ocean surface, which absorbs 90 percent of the sunlight. As the oceans heat up, the Arctic temperatures rise. Sea ice extent is a measurement of the area where there is at least 15 percent coverage of sea ice. Satellites and ground measurements are used to determine sea ice extent. The Arctic melt season typically begins in March and ends in September with the annual minimum extent. The date of the annual minimum has trended later in recent years due to a lengthening melt season. Key excerpt from the NSIDC sea ice page. Changes in the timing of the sea ice minimum extent are especially important because more of the sun's energy reaches Earth's surface during the Arctic summer than during the Arctic winter. As explained above, sea ice reflects much of the sun's radiation back into space, whereas dark, ice-free ocean water absorbs more of the sun's energy. So, reduced sea ice during the sunnier summer months has a big impact on the Arctic's overall energy balance.

Excerpts from the MIT News story... Since the 1990s, scientists have predicted based on climate models that the intensity of extreme rain events around the world should increase with rising global temperatures. Current observations have so far verified this trend on a broad, global scale. But knowing how extreme storms will change on a more specific, regional scale has been a trickier picture to resolve, as climate data is not equally available in all countries, or even continents, and the signal of climate change is masked by weather noise to a greater extent on the regional scale. According to the new report, the most extreme rainfall events in a majority of regions across the globe will increase in intensity by 3 to 15 percent, depending on region, for every degree Celsius the Earth's average temperature warms. For example, much of North America and Europe would experience increases in the intensity of extreme rainfall by about 25 percent if the global average temperature rises by 4 degrees Celsius over the next 100 years, which is what many climate models are predicting based on a relatively high release of greenhouse gases worldwide. However, there are also a few regions of the world, such as those located over subtropical oceans just outside the tropical equatorial belt, that are projected to see a decrease in these extreme rainfall events. “The subtropics are generally dry, and if you move the region of descending air poleward, you would get some regions with increases, and others with decreases [in extreme rainfall],” said Paul O’Gorman, a co-author on the paper and associate professor of atmospheric science in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. “However, we found that this only explained half of the decreases from changes in winds, so it’s still something of a mystery as to why you get a decrease in precipitation extremes there.” How may all this happen? As a region warms due to human-induced emissions of carbon dioxide, winds loft that warm, moisture-laden air up through the atmosphere, where it condenses and rains back down to the surface. But changes in strength of the local winds also influence the intensity of a region’s most extreme rainstorms. “The observations are telling us there will be increases [in extreme rainfall] at almost all latitudes, but if you want to know what’s going to happen at the scale of a continent or smaller, it’s a much more difficult question,” O’Gorman says. “There is interest around the world in the question of whether to adjust codes to adapt to a changing climate and precipitation, particularly for flooding,\" said O'Gorman.

The research team analyzed data for the last 150 years and found clear evidence of change points, which are points in time after which biological activity clearly increased in the past 50 years. This data indicated that plants and soils will change substantially , even with only modest further warming, according to the study. A close view of Antarctic moss. “The sensitivity of moss growth to past temperature rises suggests that ecosystems will alter rapidly under future warming, leading to major changes in the biology and landscape of this iconic region,” said Professor Dan Charman, who led the research project in Exeter. “In short, we could see Antarctic greening to parallel well-established observations in the Arctic.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"801aeb848c4fcc9934a5a0a37cce16d1d3e70f5b"}

Recent flood event that occurred in my native state of Rhode Island. Image courtesy NOAA. It is well known that there has been an increase in the number of storms with extreme precipitation in the northeastern U.S. (New England, NY, NJ, PA, MD, DE, WV) over the past century. However, since 1996, it appears that there has been a much more notable surge in these events, according to the new study. Excerpt from the Dartmouth story via EurekAlert.... \"Looking at where the increases in extreme precipitation are occurring across the Northeast, interestingly we find that it's not just one part of the Northeast, say the coast, that is experiencing more heavy rainfall events, it's relatively uniform across the region,\" says Jonathan M. Winter, assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth, who served as one of the co-authors of the study. From 1996 to 2014, the extreme precipitation in the northeastern U.S. was 53 percent higher than from 1901-1995. These increases applied to most of the Northeast, with the exception of western New York, western Pennsylvania and a few areas in the Middle Atlantic. The researchers used actual weather station data from the Global Historical Climatology Network (NOAA) to conduct this study. An extreme event was generally defined as weather station recording two or more inches of precipitation in a day. The team found that the increases in extreme precipitation were mostly driven by extreme storms, especially during the spring and fall seasons. The study does note that nor'easters (mainly spring) and tropical cyclones (mainly fall) may possibly be key drivers for such changes in the spring and fall. The researchers plan a future study to find out what is driving these increases in extreme precipitation since 1996 and will look at the specific weather events associated with these changes. It is also noted that with climate change, a warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture, which is likely to affect frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation. ---- This study was recently published in the American Meteorological Society's (AMS) Journal of Hydrometeorology.

Robert Rohde, Lead Scientist with Berkeley Earth, said “The record temperature in 2016 appears to come from a strong El Nino imposed on top of a long-term global warming trend that continues unabated.” Richard Muller, Scientific Director of Berkeley Earth, said: “We project that continued global warming will lead us to an average temperature not yet experienced by civilization. It would be wise to slow or halt this rise. The most effective and economic approach would be to encourage nuclear power, substitution of natural gas for future coal plants and continued improvement of energy efficiency.” The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"ec0ae3a890eb2d69f22a090213139f19794c63a7"}

Previously, the general accepted idea was that the Arctic sea ice extent was unaffected by human-caused climate change before the 1970s. Recently recovered observational records from 1950 to 1975 show that there was an increase in sea ice during the period followed by a decrease in sea ice from 1975 to 2005, according to the AGU report . The AGU team determined that particles of air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels may have masked the effects of global warming in the third quarter of the 20th century in the eastern Arctic. The air pollution particles, which are sulfate aerosols, reflect sunlight back to space, which in turn produces a cooling influence at the surface. This cooling from the buildup in aerosols may have led to this increase in sea ice extent that was recorded by Russian aerial surveys of the region between 1950 and 1975. The authors used computer modeling to test the aerosol idea. The simulations show the cooling contribution of aerosols offset the ongoing warming influence of increasing greenhouse gases over the mid-20th century in that part of the Arctic. This weak aerosol cooling effect diminished after 1980 as cleaner air regulations took hold. Some aerosols such as black carbon from forest fires can darken sea ice, which in turn increases the rate of melting ice.

UKMET expects a rise of 2.5 parts per million (ppm) of CO2 for 2017, which would send the total global concentration to 408 ppm. The annual average increase at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has been around 2.1 ppm over the past decade compared to an average increase of only 0.7 ppm during the 1950s. The rate increase can vary greatly from year to year. During El Nino years we typically see higher rates of increase. For example, during the strong El Nino year of 2015 there was an increase of 3.4 ppm. Scientists from the UKMET office also believe that the total could briefly reach 410 ppm during May 2017 when we typically see the seasonal peak of CO2 concentration. If the current rate of increase continues we will likely see a doubling of CO2 concentration well before the end of this century when compared to pre-industrial times. Recent research has indicated that a doubling of CO2 concentration could warm the planet by 3 degrees C. in the next few decades and up to 6 degrees C. over the next few centuries. Key excerpts from the New Scientist article....... The continuing rapid rise in atmospheric levels might appear to be at odds with estimates that human emissions from energy and industry have barely grown in the last three years, largely thanks to a decline in coal use in China. However, these estimates don’t include emissions from land-use change, such as the clearing of forests. The current lull in growth of fossil fuel emissions is probably only temporary, many experts believe. And to limit global warming, human emissions from all sources need to fall to below zero.

The earlier (2015) report from NOAA, which I blogged about last year, determined that modern ocean temperature sensing buoys had a cold bias. Based on that information, the NOAA scientists concluded that the world's oceans warmed at a rate of 0.12 of a degree Celsius per decade since 2000, which is almost two times higher than previous estimates of 0.07 of a degree Celsius per decade. That correction brought the rate of ocean temperature rise in line with estimates from the previous 30-year period (1970-1999), according to the Berkeley News report. In this latest study, the Berkeley researchers used independent data from buoys, robotic floats (ARGO) and satellites, which confirmed the 2015 NOAA report. Image courtesy of Berkeley News and Zeke Hausfather. Key excerpts from the Berkeley News report...... Climate change skeptics attacked the NOAA researchers and a House of Representatives committee subpoenaed the scientists’ emails. NOAA agreed to provide data and respond to any scientific questions but refused to comply with the subpoena, a decision supported by scientists who feared the “chilling effect” of political inquisitions. In each case, using data from only one instrument type – either satellites, buoys or Argo floats – the results matched those of the NOAA group, supporting the case that the oceans warmed 0.12 of a degree Celsius per decade over the past two decades, nearly twice the previous estimate. In other words, the upward trend seen in the last half of the 20th century continued through the first 15 years of the 21st: there was no hiatus. “Our results mean that essentially NOAA got it right, that they were not cooking the books,” said lead author Zeke Hausfather, a graduate student in UC Berkeley’s Energy and Resources Group.

A diagram of the AMOC AMOC is responsible for carrying oceanic heat northward in the Atlantic Ocean. It consists of a lower limb of denser, colder water that flows south and an upper limb of warm, salty water that flows north. The system is a major factor for regional climate change, affecting the Atlantic rim countries, especially those in Europe, according to the Yale News report. Based on this new research from Yale University, changes to the AMOC could occur quite abruptly in geologic terms due to the influence of climate change. One example is additional carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas) in the atmosphere warms the cold water of the North Atlantic, which has an impact on the behavior of the AMOC. Current climate modeling was found to be systematically biased toward a stable AMOC regime. However, a new bias-corrected model predicts a future collapse of the AMOC, which would lead to prominent cooling over the North Atlantic and neighboring areas, according to the Yale study. To be more specific, a collapse of the AMOC would cool the northern North Atlantic Ocean, which would allow an expansion of Arctic sea ice and a southward retreat of the tropical Atlantic rain belts. The study, which was led by Wei Liu (Yale), notes that these changes could happen quickly, on the order of the next few centuries. The researchers stress that this new model may still need refinement, as the accuracy of AMOC models are highly dependent on detailed information about ocean water salinity and temperature along with melting ice over a period of at least several decades. ------ This study was recently posted in the online journal Science Advances.

However, it is the wide margin in average temperature between 2016 and the previous record high set in 2014 that is jaw-dropping. For the state as a whole, 2014 averaged 4.3 degrees F. above the long-term average. For 2016, the state's mean temperature departure was +5.9 deg. F., which is a whopping 1.6 degree difference! The NOAA chart below shows the mean annual temperature departures for Alaska as a whole from 1949 to 2015. Note the clear warming trend for the period. (The 2016 data point is not included in this chart.) Four of the five warmest years on record in Alaska have occurred in the 21st century. A combination of factors such as the lingering effects of El Nino, unusually high sea surface temperatures surrounding Alaska, low sea ice and the overall, longer-term warming influence due to human produced greenhouse gases contributed to the incredible warmth of 2016. The warmer- to cooler-than-average daily ratio in Alaska for 2016 was an astounding 9:1. (see NOAA image below). Note that most of the below average days were toward the end of the year, which may be due in part to the increasing influence of La Nina.

The graphs below show the sea ice extent for selected years. The dashed line in the Arctic graph (top) is the plot of the record low year of 2012. The dashed line in the Antarctic graph (second image below) is the plot of the record high year of 2013. In the Arctic, record low monthly extents were set in January, February, April, May, June, October and November. In the Antarctic, record low monthly extents were set during November and December of 2016. For the Arctic region, 2016 tied 2007 for the second lowest sea ice extent minimum on record. Records go back to 1979. Again, the record lowest sea ice extent minimum was set in the September of 2012. The experts at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) state that the summer of 2016 was unusually stormy in the Arctic and that may be the reason that 2016 did not end up lower than 2012 for sea ice extent. When it is stormy, sea ice tends to spread out and the increase in cloudiness tends to favor cooler conditions in the Arctic summer compared to normal. For the Antarctic region, sea ice extent was near normal for the first half of 2016, according to the NSIDC. However, sea ice extent then trended below normal for the second half of the year with record low extents toward the end of 2016.

Last year averaged 0.94 degrees Celsius above the 20th century average for global land/ocean surface combined. This beats out the previous record of +0.90 C which was set in 2015. Last year was also the 40th consecutive year that the average annual global temperature was above the 20th century average. NOAA also reported that there was a string of eight consecutive high monthly temperature records (Jan-Aug) that were set in 2016. All 16 years of this century rank among the 17 warmest on record; the records go back to 1880. The five warmest years on record have all occurred since 2010, according to NOAA. The strong El Nino during early 2016 clearly had an overall warming influence on the planet in addition to the record warmth of the global oceans. However, El Nino cannot explain most of this warming. Clearly, the steady increase in atmospheric, man-made greenhouse gas concentration is playing the lead role. NOAA also reported that global annual temperatures are increasing at a rate of 0.07 degrees Celsius per decade since 1880, but have increased at a rate of 0.17 C since 1970. There was also a higher number of extreme precipitation and drought events that occurred across the world in 2016. This is in line with climate change impact projections. NASA NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) also reports that 2016 was the warmest year on record globally.

This is not a surprise, as climate modeling has been showing this same scenario under climate change, but at a faster rate than what the research team from the University of Southampton (UK) was able to determine. In order to reach their conclusion, the researchers analyzed the salt concentration of the world's oceans. More rain and outflow from rivers in a region of an ocean means sea water gets diluted and therefore becomes less salty. More evaporation in another region takes away fresh water and leaves salt behind making that region more saline, according to the EurekAlert report The team found that wetter regions such as those found in Northern Europe are getting wetter and dry regions are getting drier by about 2 percent over the last 60 years. This process is called amplification of the water cycle. Earlier research and climate modeling estimated that this amplification of the water cycle was happening at 7 percent per every one degree C. of global warming. However, this latest study found that it was closer to 3 to 4 percent, which is likely due to a weakening of the atmospheric circulation that transports freshwater from the dry and wet regions of the globe. \"Although we have found that this process is happening slower than first thought, if global warming exceeds 3°C, wet regions will likely get more than 10 per cent wetter and dry regions more than 10 per cent drier, which could have disastrous implications for river flows and agriculture,\" said Dr. Nikolaos Skliris, a Research Fellow at the University of Southampton who led the study.

However, a new study from the University of Washington that used statistical techniques to analyze 37 mountain glaciers around the world found that for a majority of the glaciers the observed retreat was more than 99 percent likely due to climate change More specifically, the research team analyzed specific glaciers (about 7 glaciers in each of five geographic reasons across the world) with a history of lengthy observations and nearby weather records of temperature and precipitation. Key excerpts from the study..... The authors used statistical tools to compare the natural, weather-induced variations in a glacier’s length with its observed changes over the last 130 years, and establish a signal-to-noise ratio. They then use that to calculate the probability that observed retreats would have happened without any background change in the climate. Overall, the results show that changes in the 37 glaciers’ lengths are between two and 15 standard deviations away from their statistical means. That represents some of the highest signal-to-noise ratios yet documented in natural systems’ response to climate change. “Because of their decades-long response times, we found that glaciers are actually among the purest signals of climate change,” said Gerard Roe, a UW professor of Earth and space sciences.

According to NOAA, November 2016 averaged 0.73 of a degree Celsius above the 20th century average for global land/ocean combined, making it the 5th warmest November on record. The warmest November on record was set last year (+0.96). A quick look below at the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) global surface temperature analysis for November shows that November 2016 was the third warmest November on record going back to 1890. The anomaly values are lower mainly due to the fact that the JMA temperatures are measured against the warmer 1981-2010 period. The long-term warming trend on the JMA is indisputable. Back to NOAA, the September to November period (Northern Hemisphere fall) the globe averaged 0.77 of a degree Celsius above average, which places it in second place behind 2015 (+0.95). So far this year (January-November) the globe is averaging 0.94 C above the 20th century average, according to the NOAA database. This puts 2016 on pace to replace 2015 as the warmest year on record. The current annual record is +0.90 C. Clearly, the record global warmth over the past two years cannot be explained by natural variability alone. The NOAA chart below shows the plot of global temperature anomalies since the mid-1800s (black line). The thin red line shows the climate model average global anomalies when factoring just natural influences during the period (very little, if any, warming trend). The dark red line shows the climate model global temperature anomaly projections when factoring both natural and the human influences on CO2. As you can see, the dark red line matches up pretty well with the actual observations. An analysis of the planet's extreme heat in 2015 found that almost all of the increased risk for such an extremely hot year could be attributed to global warming due to rising greenhouse gases and other human-caused factors. More than 99% of the increased risk was attributable to human causes according to an ensemble analysis of eight models.

A team of climate scientists from the University of Delaware, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and other institutions determined that the Earth's oceans absorbed the extra heat gained as a result of the increase in greenhouse gases. “Scientists have more confidence now that Earth’s ocean has continued to warm continuously through time. But the rate of global surface warming can fluctuate due to natural variations in the climate system over periods of a decade or so,\" said study co-author Veronica Nieves (JPL). The ocean is most important to consider when monitoring the Earth's energy budget. The world's oceans can store a tremendous amount of the the Earth's heat, especially compared to the capacity of the land surface or atmosphere, according to the American Geophysical Union report. Latest trends in ocean heat content: As we have shown in previous blogs on this site, ocean heat content may be the best measure of how much the world is actually warming.

According to the new report , global temperatures peaked in February of 2016 at 1.5 degrees C above the level it was at during the start of the industrial revolution. For the record, global temperatures reached the +1.0 degree departure (above the level at the start of the Industrial revolution) in 1998. Since that February temperature peak, the average global temperature has only dropped 0.3 degrees C due to low global sea ice extent. The researchers looked at the ERA-Interim and the JRA-55 reanalyses of synoptic data and the monthly surface temperature data sets from HadCrut4 (UK), which goes back to 1850 and that from NOAA, which goes back to 1880. In conclusion, the team determined that the climate surface temperature data sets and reanalyses agree well in their depiction of the net warming that has taken place on the Earth's surface over the past 3-4 decades. They also agree on the character of variability over this period and the extreme warmth over the past year due in part to the strong El Nino, lack of sea ice and high sea surface temperatures. Overall, the researchers conclude that the Earth has warmed in a range from 0.55 to 0.75 degrees C. from the 1720-1800 period to the 1986-2005 period.

Despite the record low extent, you can still see that the longer-term trend for November in the Antarctic is still slightly positive. That is clearly not the case in the Arctic as we see a sharp, long-term decline in sea ice since 1979. In addition to the overall, long-term global warming trend, the combination of unusually high November air temperatures, much above-normal sea surface temperatures and persistent winds was the reason for the record low extents last month.

A tidal gauge Tidal gauges are high quality instruments that produce the longest running record of sea level changes. Global network of tidal gauges Utilizing satellite data, the research team determined that there was nothing wrong with the gauges themselves, but it was found that a higher percentage of these gauges tended to be located where sea level rise last century was less than the true global average. Note: Sea level does not change at the same pace everywhere at the same time, according to the NASA report. Sea level change resulting from Greenland ice melt, derived from NASA GRACE measurements. Black circles show locations of the best historical water level records, which underestimate global average sea level rise due to Greenland melt by about 25 percent. Credit: University of Hawaii/NASA-JPL/Caltech. One of the key processes the researchers looked at is the effect of “ice melt fingerprints,” which are global patterns of sea level change caused by deviations in Earth’s rotation and local gravity that occur when a large ice mass melts. (via the NASA report) The team found that sea level drops in the vicinity of a melting glacier instead of rising as might be expected. The loss of ice mass reduces the glacier’s gravitational influence, causing nearby ocean water to migrate away. But far from the glacier, the water it has added to the ocean causes sea level to rise at a much greater rate. (from NASA) A majority of locations with global ice melt were in the northern hemisphere during the 20th century. The researchers determined that many of the historical water level records of the 20th century were taken from places where the melt fingerprints of the northern hemisphere sources resulted in reduced local sea level change compared to the global average. Based on the research, the team concluded that the average global sea level rise during the 20th century was closer to 6.7 inches rather than the earlier estimate of 5.5 inches. ------ An introduction to tide gauge data Sea level change FAQ's The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"42f59ad2404f3b21a5ce1960c04ec1681f687f97"}

The result of this weakening is an increased probability of cold surface air from the high latitudes shifting southward into the middle latitudes. Over the past three decades there has also been a rapid warming of the surface air over the Arctic region and northeastern Canada. According to the report, it is unknown if the location of the polar vortex has also experienced a persistent change in response to Arctic climate change The researchers are also unsure if the changes in the position of the polar vortex will have implications for the climate system. Polar stratospheric ozone depletion and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) may also have impacts on the vortex position. The research team found that the polar vortex shifted persistently from North America and towards the Eurasian continent during the month of February over the past three decades. The main cause for this shift was likely due to Arctic sea ice loss, which caused an enhancement of zonal wavenumber-1 waves, especially over the Barents and Kara seas. A possible secondary cause is an increase in snow cover over the Eurasian Continent, especially during the fall months. This shift in the polar vortex enhanced wintertime cooling over parts of the Eurasian continent and North America. This has partly offset the tropospheric climate warming over these continents during the past three decades. The left image below shows the typical position of the polar vortex over the Arctic region. The right image shows a piece of the polar vortex shifted much farther to the south, which brings cold air into the middle latitudes. In closing, the researchers believe that this change in the polar vortex could lead to a colder late winter/early spring climate over some parts of the continents, which partly offsets the underlying climate warming during these seasons.

However, new research from the University of California (Irvine) and the University of Washington suggests that plants will need less water under a high CO2 environment. Image courtesy NOAA. The reason for this finding, according to the study, is the fact that water conserved by plants under high CO2 conditions compensates for much of the effect of warmer temperatures, thus the plants retain more water on land than has been predicted in recent drought assessments.

Satellite image of a winter storm in the eastern U.S.. Image courtesy NASA. The study especially focused on the enhanced warming of the Arctic region and how it may impact the position of the jet stream farther to the south. The jet stream is a river of strong winds high above the surface that direct the pathways of storms. The research team found that there is a so-called \"tug of war\" between how these different environmental forces could change the position of storm tracks, according to the report. The role of clouds It is understood that increased atmospheric CO2 leads the clouds in high latitudes to reflect more solar radiation, which in turn has a cooling influence on that region. This cooling in the far north increases the temperature gradient between the pole and the equator, which would lead to a more poleward shift in the storm track. On the other hand, the same clouds also enhance the greenhouse effect in the high latitudes by trapping more outgoing, longwave radiation, which in turn has a warming influence on the region. This would also decrease the temperature gradient between the pole and the equator, leading to more high level blocking (high pressure aloft near the pole) and a suppression of the mid-latitude storm track. Impact of clouds on solar radiation. The study found many examples of opposing influences affecting the position of storm tracks. These included the opposing influence of warming in the tropical upper atmosphere and Arctic amplification (enhanced surface warming in the Arctic), both of which occur in models in response to climate change. Such shifts in position have the potential to significantly change patterns of rain, snow, heat waves and cold outbreaks. For example, if storm tracks shift poleward, New York and Chicago will likely experience warmer weather and less snow. And there’s already evidence that the shift of the austral storm track southward—which was caused by the ozone hole at the South Pole—has impacted rain in Australia and South America. The research team states that improved/expanded observations and computer simulations are needed to further understand how these critical storm tracks may shift in the future due to the increase in carbon dioxide. ----- This study 'Storm track processes and the opposing influences of climate change' was published in the journal Nature Geoscience.

A human induced combination of farming and extraction of groundwater and fossil fuels, along with natural factors such as thermal subsidence and fault motion are causing these metropolitan areas in coastal zones to subside at a higher rate than previously thought. One such city, New Orleans (Mississippi Delta) saw a subsidence rate as high as 1.4 inches per year, while the fastest rate of sinking was found in China's populated Huanghe Delta with a rate of 10 inches per year.

While both human and natural factors contribute to subsidence, the natural processes—apart from tectonic disturbances—mostly act over very long timescales.

The researchers found that a combination of higher temperatures and lower humidity caused an additional 16,000 square miles of western forest to burn between 1984 and 2015, which is equivalent to an area slightly larger than the size of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined. \"No matter how hard we try, the fires are going to keep getting bigger, and the reason is really clear,\" said study coauthor Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \"Climate is really running the show in terms of what burns. We should be getting ready for bigger fire years than those familiar to previous generations.\" (via Eurekalert) “We’re no longer waiting for human-caused climate change to leave its fingerprint on wildfire across the western U.S. It’s already here,” said John Abatzoglou, the study’s lead author and an associate professor of geography in UI’s College of Science. “Over the last several decades we’ve seen longer fire seasons, larger fires and more area burned — and those observations led us to ask, ‘Why?’ What we found was that human-caused climate change played a resounding role in observed increases in forest fire activity.\" The study focused on the forested regions of the west from the Pacific Ocean to the Rockies and is the first of its kind to quantify the degree to which human-caused climate change has increased wildfire activity in this region of the world, according to the University of Idaho news. The researchers found that spring and summer temperatures warmed by 2 to 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 1.5 degrees Celsius) since 1950, which is in agreement with the warming that climate models attribute to human-caused climate change. This warming led to significant drying within western U.S. forests, accounting for approximately 55 percent of the documented increases in forest aridity from 1979 to 2015. The remaining 45 percent was due to natural climate variations that caused reductions in humidity and precipitation in some regions. (via University of Idaho news) Not surprisingly, fire suppression and forest management practices in parts of the West has also played an important role in the increase. Fewer fires have led to overgrowth in many forests, so there is now more fuel available to burn when conditions get dry, according to the report. ------- This study was recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Hurricane Sandy bearing down on the Middle Atlantic coast in 2012. The research team with members from Rutgers University, Princeton University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution used a combination of historical records such as tidal gauge and geological data from the New York City area along with computer model projections to reach their conclusion. The primary reason for this predicted increase in flood risk is due to the projected acceleration of sea level rise through the end of the century. Key excerpts from the News at Princeton.... and Rutgers Today. “The grand answer is that things are going to get worse by 2100,” says Benjamin Horton, who is professor of Marine and Coastal Sciences in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences. “If nothing changes with hurricanes, sea-level rise alone will increase the frequency of Sandy-like events by 2100.” The researchers noted that every Sandy-sized storm surge doesn't necessarily equate to flooding like that seen during Sandy, which also happened to hit during a particularly high astronomical tide (the tide due to the gravitational pull of Earth’s moon). The summation of the storm surge and the astronomical tide is called the “storm tide,\" the total height of the floodwaters. A hurricane that produced the same size storm surge as Sandy, but that peaked during a low astronomical tide, might not cause the same catastrophic flooding. “The effect of astronomical tide will be accounted for in the future,” said Ning Lin, the lead author of the paper and a Princeton assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering “but the tide component doesn’t change with the climate and so the increasing trend of flood frequency will be similar.” There is still much debate about whether hurricanes are becoming more frequent and intense. \"But even if storms occur at the same frequency and strength, our estimates suggest the frequency of surge floods will significantly increase based on rising sea level,” said Lin. “We ask, ‘What is likely?’ and ‘What are the extremes?’\" said Robert Kopp of Rutgers University. \"We take into account factors that cause local sea level to vary from global sea level. And we’ve shown, through geological investigations, that our projections are consistent with the assumption that temperature and sea level will be related in the future as they have been over the past two thousand years.” Projections are not predictions and, Horton says, the spread between what “likely” and “extreme” is an indication of the complexity of future projection. “Things are only going to get worse by 2100,” Horton says. “It’s just a question of how much worse it will get.

The research team, led by Joel Norris, determined through the analysis of corrected satellite cloud records from the 1980s-2000s that there has been a poleward retreat of mid-latitude, cloudy storm tracks, an expansion of subtropical dry zones and an increasing trend in the height of the highest cloud tops.

The team, which was led by Yu Kosaka and Shang-Ping Xie, created the simulation by forcing sea surface temperature over the tropical Pacific to follow the observed variability. This new method will allow scientists to measure and monitor the pace of man-made global warming by determining that the contribution of human activities to warming in the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean can be distinguished from natural variability. The strong El Nino of early 2016 below is an example of natural climate variability. Key excerpts from the Scripps news report..... “The climate system includes naturally occurring cycles that complicate the measurement of global warming due to the anthropogenic increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases,” said Xie. “We can isolate the anthropogenic warming by removing the internally generated natural variability.” When Kosaka and Xie removed as a variable the natural warming and cooling of the Pacific Ocean, the rise of global mean surface temperature became a more linear increase, one that began to accelerate more sharply in the 1960s. It had been natural Pacific decadal variations that temporarily slowed down or speeded up the warming trend, leading to the staircase pattern. The researchers found that the global mean surface temperature has not changed much for 1998-2014, a time period known as the hiatus that has been tied to naturally occurring tropical Pacific cooling. Raw data show a warming of 0.9° C for the recent five-year period of 2010-2014 relative to 1900 while Kosaka and Xie’s calculation yields a much higher anthropogenic warming of 1.2° C after correcting for the natural variability effect.

The main reasons for this were issues with how global temperatures were recorded long ago. Some of these issues (quirks) include..... 1. Lack of historic temperature records from the Arctic region due to past inaccessibility. It is also important to note that the Arctic has also been warming faster than any other part of the planet. 2. Historical data was a mixture of air and water temperature data, while computer model results refer to air temperatures only. This difference skews the historical record toward the cool side since water warms less than air, according to the NASA JPL story. 3. There was much more Arctic sea ice back in the 1800s when temperature records began. Thus most of the early observations in the Arctic were recorded over nearby land areas. In later years, as the average extent of the ice decreased the observations were switched to water temperatures, which in turn pushed down the reported temperature range. This is the first study to actually calculate the impacts of these historical temperature recording issues, according to NASA's Mark Richardson, who was the lead author of this study. NASA global temperature trend since 1880. Key excerpt from the NASA JPL report..... These quirks hide around 19 percent of global air-temperature warming since the 1860s. That's enough that calculations generated from historical records alone were cooler than about 90 percent of the results from the climate models that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) uses for its authoritative assessment reports. In the apples-to-apples comparison, the historical temperature calculation was close to the middle of the range of calculations from the IPCC's suite of models. Based on the results of this study, the research team concludes that there is no evidence that climate models overestimate Transient Climate Response (TCR) when their output is processed in the same way as the HadCrut4 observation based temperature record. The research team's best observation-based estimate for TCR is 1.66 degrees C., which is consistent with the IPCC's most recent 5%-95% range of 1.0-3.3 deg.

As the planet continues to warm the sea level rise should continue to accelerate, according to climate model projections. However, this has not been the case over the past 20+ years. The report , published in the journal Scientific Reports , determined that the expected acceleration in sea level rise is likely hidden by the impacts of the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. That particular volcanic eruption sent vast amounts of sunlight-blocking aerosols high into the atmosphere, causing the oceans to cool and sea levels to drop by 6 mm immediately before TOPEX/Poseidon began recording observations. Since then, the rate of sea level rise has been held fairly steady at close to 3 mm per year. Global mean sea level time series. Courtesy University of Colorado Sea level Research Group. The NCAR study finds that the lower starting point distorts the calculation of sea level rise acceleration for the past couple of decades. Key excerpts from the NCAR report..... This higher-than-normal rate of sea level rise in the early part of the satellite record makes it appear that the rate of sea level rise has not accelerated over time and may actually have decreased somewhat. In fact, according to the study, if the Pinatubo eruption had not occurred—leaving sea level at a higher starting point in the early 1990s—the satellite record would have shown a clear acceleration. \"When we used climate model runs designed to remove the effect of the Pinatubo eruption, we saw the rate of sea level rise accelerating in our simulations,\" said NCAR scientist John Fasullo, who led the study. \"Now that the impacts of Pinatubo have faded, this acceleration should become evident in the satellite measurements in the coming decade, barring another major volcanic eruption.\" “This study shows that large volcanic eruptions can significantly impact the satellite record of global average sea level change. So we must be careful to consider these effects when we look for the effects of climate change in the satellite-based sea level record,\" said study co-author Steve Nerem, from the University of Colorado Boulder. \"Sea level rise is potentially one of the most damaging impacts of climate change, so it's critical that we understand how quickly it will rise in the future,\" Fasullo said. \"Measurements from Jason-3 will help us evaluate what we've learned in this study and help us better plan for the future.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"e39a5ba6567e932773d31fed23678ceebe0fdd8c"}

Increasing storminess in the far north during the early summer slowed the rate of sea ice loss during that time as windier conditions caused the ice to spread out. Lower temperatures also reduced the rate of melting during that time, according to NASA. “This year is a great case study in showing how important the weather conditions are during the summer, especially in June and July, when you have 24 hours of sunlight and the sun is high in the sky in the Arctic,” said Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist from NASA. “If you get the right atmospheric conditions during those two months, they can really accelerate the ice loss. If you don’t, they can slow down any melting momentum you had. So our predictive ability in May of the September minimum is limited, because the sea ice cover is so sensitive to the early-to-mid-summer atmospheric conditions, and you can’t foresee summer weather.” Every year the Sea Ice Prediction Network makes predictions for the annual sea ice extent minimum in the Arctic.

The study, which was just published in the journal Nature Geoscience, explains that the IPO, which is an internally generated mode of climate variability, switched from a positive phase to a negative phase in 1998.

Image credit NCAR. The result of this loss of oxygen will have detrimental impacts on certain marine life by making it harder for them to breathe. The oceans receive their oxygen supply from the surface via the atmosphere or from phytoplankton, which release oxygen in the water by photosynthesis. When the oceans are warmed they absorb less oxygen and marine life tend to move more slowly. The oxygen that is absorbed has a harder time reaching deeper into the ocean because when water heats up, it expands and becomes lighter than the water below it and is less likely to sink, according to the National Science Foundation report. . “Since oxygen concentrations in the ocean naturally vary depending on variations in winds and temperature at the surface, it's been challenging to attribute any deoxygenation to climate change. This new study tells us when we can expect the effect from climate change to overwhelm the natural variability,\" said lead author Matthew Long of NCAR. Oxygen concentrations along the oceans surface constantly change due to the natural warming and cooling of the waters. The research team relied on the NCAR-based community Earth System model simulations to cut through the natural variability. Using the simulations to study dissolved oxygen gave the researchers guidance on the degree to which concentrations may have varied naturally in the past. With this information, they could determine when ocean deoxygenation due to climate change is likely to become more severe than at any point in the modeled historic range. (from NSF). In certain parts of the world's oceans the researchers found that they could detect deoxygenation caused by climate change, with more widespread detection of deoxygenation between 2030 and 2040. In order to fully understand future deoxygenation of the oceans there must be comprehensive and sustained observations of the oceans so that this information can be compared to what is being learned from the models, according to Long. ----- What is a dead zone ?

Annual global temperature trend (land/ocean surface) from 1965-2015 shows the lack of warming in the far Southern Ocean, while the Arctic ocean has experienced the most warming. Image courtesy NASA GISS. Researchers from the University of Washington and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wanted to find out the reason for this lack of warming across the far southern ocean. The team, led by lead author Kyle Armour, a UW assistant professor of oceanography and of atmospheric sciences found that unique ocean currents around Antarctica continually pull deep, centuries old water up to the surface. This cold water from deep below the surface has never experienced fossil fuel-related climate change, according to the report, which is published in the journal Nature Geoscience. One potential cause of this is persistent, strong westerly winds that surround Antarctica and push the surface water north, which in turn allows the very deep, cold water to get drawn toward the surface off the coast of Antarctica. It is estimated that it could take hundreds of years before this water reaching the surface has experienced modern global warming. A typical day on the Southern Ocean. Image courtesy NOAA. Key excerpts from University of Washington Today...... “The Southern Ocean is unique because it’s bringing water up from several thousand meters [as much as 2 miles],” Armour said. “It’s really deep, old water that’s coming up to the surface, all around the continent. You have a lot of water coming to the surface, and that water hasn’t seen the atmosphere for hundreds of years.” “The old idea was that heat taken up at the surface would just mix downward, and that’s the reason for the slow warming,” Armour said. “But the observations show that heat is actually being carried away from Antarctica, northward along the surface.” What happens to the sea water that HAS experienced the most climate change? Dyes in model simulations show that seawater that has experienced the most climate change tends to clump up around the North Pole due to the fact that in the Atlantic Ocean the northward flow of the ocean's surface continues all the way to the Arctic. “The oceans are acting to enhance warming in the Arctic while damping warming around Antarctica,” Armour said. “You can’t directly compare warming at the poles, because it’s occurring on top of very different ocean circulations.” The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"24b8df27fd3d503d307977038557f4dc1230f42b"}

Overall, the research team found that 29.4 percent of the region greened up, while 2.9 percent showed vegetation decline. NASA/USGS Landsat data shows the climate impact on vegetation in the high latitudes, according to Jeffrey Masek, who was part of the research team. Arctic tundra Landsat, like other satellite missions, can use the amount of visible and near-infrared light reflected by the green, leafy vegetation of grasses, shrubs and trees to characterize the vegetation. Then, with computer programs that track each individual pixel of data over time, researchers can see if an area is greening – if more vegetation is growing, or if individual plants are getting larger and leafier. If, however, the vegetation becomes sparser, the scientists would classify that area as browning. (via NASA) Vegetation in these northern regions are also responding to microclimates as the Landsat imagery reveals large differences over short distances. “One of the big questions is, ‘Will forest biomes migrate with warming climate?’ There hasn’t been much evidence of it to date,” Masek said. “But we can zoom in and see if it’s changing.” (via NASA) “The greening trend was unmistakable,” the researchers wrote in the April 2016 paper in Remote Sensing of Environment.

It was also over 1 million sq/km below that of May 2012. (2012 was the year with the lowest, minimum sea ice extent in the Arctic in the satellite era). Image courtesy of the NSIDC. This year's sea ice extent decline in the Arctic was running anywhere from two to four weeks ahead of 2012. In addition to May, the months of January, February and April 2016 also set new monthly record low sea ice extents in the Arctic. The latest May rate of sea ice decline in the Arctic is 2.6 percent per decade. Image courtesy NSIDC. One reason for the low sea ice extent in May is the fact that temperatures not too far above the surface averaged 2-3 deg. C. or 4-5 deg. F above the 1981-2010 average for most of the Arctic Ocean. Keep in mind, spring sea ice extent is not necessarily a good indicator of how the sea ice minimum that typically occurs in September will rank. Ice thickness Ice thickness over parts of the Arctic is similar to that of 2015, but thinner compared to the last 5 years for the whole region. According to the NSIDC report, NASA scientists recently spent a week up in Barrow, Alaska, which is along the north coast of the state. The researchers found that the sea ice was unusually thin for the time of year, with a thickness ranging from 31 to 39 inches. In an average year, the sea ice thickness at Barrow during the same time of year usually ranges from 55 to 59 inches. The locals in Barrow reported that the winter of 2015/16 was very unusual, with much more easterly winds compared to the more common westerly winds. This change in wind also certainly had an impact on the character and thickness of the ice. Antarctic sea ice extent May 2016 sea ice extent growth was slow and thus the May extent ended up slightly below average. Antarctic sea ice has been trending near-average since June 2015 after a stretch of record high monthly extents. ----------------- Note: Daily sea ice extent data is still provisional due to sensor issues.

Arctic caribou in Alaska's north slope. New research published in the Geophysical Research Letters indicates that despite a significant Arctic warming trend, there has been little change in methane emissions from melting permafrost along Alaska's north slope over the past three decades. As the Arctic continues to warm, more and more of the permafrost continues to melt, which releases previously trapped methane. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is almost 28 times more potent than the warming influence of carbon dioxide over a 100-year timescale, according to the American Geophysical Union report. It is estimated that the Arctic permafrost contains 2.5 times as much carbon as has been emitted since the beginning of the industrial revolution. A layer of Arctic permafrost. Scientists calculate that Arctic permafrost contains 1,000 gigatons of carbon. In addition to being emitted as methane, carbon could also be released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide carried off by meltwater into river systems or taken up by vegetation, according to the report. The research group, which included NOAA, NASA and other University partners examined 29 years of continuous, precision measurements of atmospheric methane and other gases from the NOAA Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory. Key excerpts from the AGU report........ “There has been a huge increase in Arctic warming, and while we do see spikes in methane due to short-term temperature changes, we’re not seeing a long-term change in methane levels,” said Colm Sweeney, a CIRES scientist working at NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder and lead author of the new study. But that doesn’t mean thawing permafrost isn’t releasing carbon, Sweeney said. “It’s happening. It just isn’t showing up as methane.” “Bacteria that produce methane and bacteria that consume methane will both become more active as temperatures get warmer,” said Steven Wofsy of Harvard University and co-author of the study. “Our study suggests that over the past 30 years, these processes have balanced out in the study area.” The researchers conclude that observed short-term methane spikes from the Arctic will likely have little impact on global atmospheric methane levels in the long-term. With little observed change in methane emissions, researchers are further examining the Barrow observatory’s dataset for signs that the permafrost has been emitting carbon dioxide, by far the most significant of the greenhouse gasses, as it may be more affected by large temperature changes (and by extension, melting permafrost) in the Arctic, according to the AGU report.

Scientists monitor both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, but Arctic sea ice is more significant to understanding global climate because much more Arctic ice remains through the summer months, reflecting sunlight and cooling the planet. Sea ice near the Antarctic Peninsula, south of the tip of South America, has recently experienced a significant decline. The rest of Antarctica has experienced a small increase in Antarctic sea ice. Antarctica and the Arctic are reacting differently to climate change partly because of geographical differences. Antarctica is a continent surrounded by water, while the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land. Wind and ocean currents around Antarctica isolate the continent from global weather patterns, keeping it cold. In contrast, the Arctic Ocean is intimately linked with the climate systems around it, making it more sensitive to changes in climate. Arctic sea ice volume estimate.

New research, just published in the journal Nature Geoscience attempts to find out what happens to much of the freshwater that empties into the ocean from the melting ice sheet on Greenland each summer. According to the study, which was led by the University of Georgia, there has been an acceleration of ice mass loss along the ice sheet during recent decades. In addition to biological impacts in the ocean, the researchers found evidence that this meltwater could alter ocean currents and impact the normal formation of sea ice. Using a high resolution ocean simulation model that tracks meltwater runoff, the team was surprised to find that most of the meltwater found off the west coast of Greenland actually came from ice on the east coast of Greenland. It was also found that meltwater from the the west coast of Greenland is usually kept pinned to the coastline by strong prevailing winds, which eventually force it northward toward Baffin Bay. \"Meltwater from Greenland is directed by the surrounding ocean currents, but its fate depends on when and where the runoff occurs and the wind fields driving ocean currents,\" said study co-author Thomas Mote, Distinguished Research Professor of Geography at UGA. (from UGA Today ) The journey of meltwater from east to west can take up to 60 days, with most of the water getting deposited into the Labrador Sea. \"The meltwater that comes from the east coast could have different qualities from the meltwater on the west coast, including different nutrient compositions,\" he said. \"We need to take the origins of this meltwater into account when we study the effects of ice sheet melt, as it could impact the oceans differently depending on where it comes from.\" And this is a problem that is only going to get worse, said study co-author Renato Castelao, an associate professor of marine sciences in UGA's Franklin College of Arts and Sciences., citing scientific models that suggest the amount of meltwater runoff from Greenland could more than double before the end of this century. (from UGA Today) Up to 50-60 percent of the meltwater runoff coming off the southeast coast of Greenland is being transported west, which is causing significant salinity and stratification anomalies far from the coast. (Water stratification occurs when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia. via Wikipedia) Future climate scenarios predict a possible doubling of meltwater runoff, which could result in a more-than-double increase in anomalies offshore that persists into the winter, according to the report. \"We need to pay careful attention to where melt and runoff is occurring and how it interacts with surrounding ocean currents, in addition to measuring the total amount of melt,\" said Mote.

Atmospheric CO2 concentration since the late 1950's from Mauna Loa Observatory. The research team, led by geoscientist Richard Zeebe of the University of Hawaii studied sediment cores from underneath the ocean floor to gather their evidence. The team developed the new approach and was able to determine the duration of the onset of an important past climate event, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), 56 million years ago, according to the National Science Foundation report. It is believed that the PETM had the largest carbon release during the past 66 million years, according to Zeebe. In order for the researchers to extract rates of change from a sediment record they had to combine analyses of chemical properties of sediment cores dating back to the PETM with numerical simulations of Earth's climate and carbon cycle, according to the report. Carbon release rates from human sources reached a record high in 2014 of about 37 billion metric tons of CO2.

The impact of abnormally low sea ice extent is most critical during the summer months when the bright white surface of the ice/snow reflects solar energy that the darker ocean waters would otherwise absorb. During the winter months, the sun is very low in the sky or doesn't rise, leaving the impacts of missing sea ice mostly felt in the atmosphere, according to Dr. Jennifer Francis, who is a climate scientist from Rutgers University. Possible reasons for the new record low maximum, according to Walt Meier who is a sea ice scientist from NASA 1. Record high surface temperatures for December through February. 2. Wind patterns during January and February were unfavorable for ice growth. According to Meier, what will likely play a bigger role in the future trend of Arctic maximum extents is warming ocean waters. Key excerpt from the NASA report..... “It is likely that we're going to keep seeing smaller wintertime maximums in the future because in addition to a warmer atmosphere, the ocean has also warmed up. That warmer ocean will not let the ice edge expand as far south as it used to,” Meier said. “Although the maximum reach of the sea ice can vary a lot each year depending on winter weather conditions, we’re seeing a significant downward trend, and that’s ultimately related to the warming atmosphere and oceans.” Since 1979, that trend has led to a loss of 620,000 square miles of winter sea ice cover, an area more than twice the size of Texas.

The revised estimate for sea-level rise comes from including new processes in the 3-dimensional ice sheet model, and testing them against past episodes of high sea-levels and ice retreat, according to the UMass news report. The scientific team, led by Robert DeConto (UMass) and David Pollard (Penn State) determined that the Antarctic Ice Sheet could potentially contribute more than one meter (39 inches) of sea-level rise by 2100 and greater than 15 meters (49 feet) by 2500 if we continue with \"business as usual\" model in terms of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. In the worst case scenario, atmospheric warming, instead of ocean warming would be the main driver of ice loss for Antarctica. DeConto and Pollard’s study was motivated by reconstructions of sea level rise during past warm periods including the previous inter-glacial (around 125,000 years ago) and earlier warm intervals like the Pliocene (around 3 million years ago). These high sea levels, ranging from a few meters to 20 meters above today, imply that the Antarctic Ice Sheet is highly sensitive to climate warming. (from UMass News) “So, at a time in the past when global average temperatures were only slightly warmer than today,” says DeConto, “sea levels were much higher. Melting of the smaller Greenland Ice Sheet can only explain a fraction of this sea-level rise, most which must have been caused by retreat on Antarctica.” (from UMass News) In order to proceed with their study, the researchers developed a new ice sheet climate model that includes \"previously under-appreciated processes\" that underline the importance of future atmospheric warming around Antarctica. “Today, summer temperatures approach or just exceed 0 degrees C. on many shelves, and due to their flat surfaces near sea level, little atmospheric warming would be needed to dramatically increase the areal extent of surface melting and summer rainfall.” (from UMass news) ----- This study is published in the current edition of the journal Nature.

According to the IPCC , Climate sensitivity is a metric used to characterize the response of the global climate system to a given forcing. It is broadly defined as the equilibrium global mean surface temperature change following a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Spread in model climate sensitivity is a major factor contributing to the range in projections of future climate changes along with uncertainties in future emission scenarios and rates of oceanic heat uptake. CO2 molecule In 2013, the IPCC estimated climate sensitivity to CO2 to average between 2.0 and 4.7 degrees C. The Yale team, led by Ivy Tan, focused on the make-up of mixed-phase clouds in the upper atmosphere, which are made up of water vapor, liquid droplets and ice particles. High and mid-level clouds. According to the Yale News article, a larger amount of ice in these clouds leads to a lower climate sensitivity to CO2 (negative feedback mechanism). Ivy and his team determined that all of the climate models started with far too much ice. \"When we ran our own simulations, which were designed to better match what we found in satellite observations, we came up with more warming,\" said Ivy. Based on their results, the Yale researchers found climate sensitivity to be closer to the 5.0 to 5.3 deg. C. range. This increase in sensitivity could have dramatic implications on climate change worldwide, according to the report. The next IPCC assessment report is expected in 2020, according to the article. “The overestimate of ice in mixed-phase clouds relative to the observations is something that many climate modelers are starting to realize,” Tan said.

Total global sea level rise is approximately 3 mm/yr, with a third of that increase due to the melting ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. However, future contributions from those two ice sheets are expected to increase. The NASA team is trying to determine where specifically on the submerged terrain around the Greenland coast are the warming, ocean waters making contact with the glacial toes. The NASA team, led by Dr. Josh Willis, will make annual flights over the next five years to Greenland's coast to document changes to the regions rapidly melting glaciers. The group is also employing a ship to use sonar to measure the shape and depth of the seafloor. The G-III aircraft that will be used for the project will use a radar interferometry instrument (GLISTIN-A) to gather critical data. The plane will also drop about 250 expendable sensors, which will measure the temperature and salinity of ocean water down to 1,000 meters. A second plane will make gravitational measurements along the Greenland coast. The reason for aerial mapping is to develop a baseline in which the research team measures the heights of all the glaciers at the glacier face. When they go back the next year and the following years they can see how much the glacier has thinned and retreated. A glacier face in Greenland. The glacier face is the location where the ocean water interacts with the ice. According to Willis, retreat is when the glacier breaks off, while thinning is when they speed up. At the conclusion of this project the NASA team hopes to present a much clearer picture about how the Greenland ice sheet contributes to sea level rise today and into the future.

The NOAA database goes back to 1880 and temperatures are measured against the 20th century average. Much of the record warmth for the globe can be attributed to record warmth in the global oceans, according to NOAA. This is the 4th time a new, annual record high global temperature has been set since 2000. The strong El Nino of 2015 (tied for strongest on record with 1997/98) clearly had a warming influence on the overall global temperature, but it cannot explain all of the warming.

Image courtesy NASA GISS. The research team, which was led by Dr. Michael Mann (Penn State University) wanted to find out how likely recent observed global temperature records would be with or without human influences. In order to conduct the study the team used the latest CMIP5 climate model simulations with observations of global and hemispheric mean temperature. What they found was that individual record years and observed runs of record-setting temperatures were extremely unlikely to occur in the absence of man-made global warming, but not nearly as unlikely as some press reports suggested. However, these record temperatures were quite likely to have occurred in the presence of man-made global warming. Image courtesy NASA GISS. A total of 13 of the 15 and 9 of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2000. The researchers concluded that this string of records were extremely unlikely to have occurred due to natural variability alone. The odds of having 13 of the 15 warmest years on record to have occurred since 2000 were calculated to be 1-in-10,000 and 1-in-770 to have 9 of the 10 warmest years since 2000. Qualitatively similar results are obtained regardless of (Supplementary Information) (a) which of the two approaches is used (anthropogenic-only or all-forcing experiments), (b) which surface temperature dataset (GISTEMP or HadCRUT4) is employed, (c) whether model surface air temperature is substituted for sea surface temperature over ocean regions, (d) whether or not simulations are restricted to only those that include both aerosol indirect effects and (e) whether a parametric or non-parametric Monte Carlo procedure is used. (from Nature.com) The researchers also found it even less likely that natural variability might have produced the observed specific individual yearly temperature records. Somewhat related to this study, Gavin Schmidt (NASA) tweeted this week that he estimates that this current El Nino (natural warming influence on the globe) contributed about .07 degrees C. of warming to the 2015 average. So without the El Nino, 2015 still would have set a new record high globally, based on his estimate. The study estimated odds of no more than 1-in-1,000,000 that the 2014 temperature record would have arisen from natural variability alone for both the Northern Hemisphere and the globe. This was also the conclusion for other record years of 1998, 2005 and 2010. Finally, our analysis allows us to comment on the odds of the observed records having been observed, given that there has been anthropogenic warming. We find that the 13/15 and 9/10 record temperature runs were very likely to have been observed with likelihoods of occurrence of 76% and 88% respectively (NH) and 72% and 83% respectively (globe). (from Nature.com) In conclusion, recent record temperature years are ~600 to 130,000 times more likely to have occurred under man-made global warming than in it's absence, according to the report.

The research team used tree-ring data and historical documentary evidence to derive a new European summer temperature reconstruction, according to the EurekAlert article.

The oceans are warming over many regions, depth ranges and time periods, although neither everywhere nor constantly. The ocean warming signal emerges most clearly when averaged over time spans of a decade or more. Global ocean surface temperature anomalies since 1880. Average global ocean temperature for 2015 was the warmest on record. Courtesy NOAA. The Earth is absorbing more heat than it is emitting back into space and nearly all of this excess heat is entering the oceans and being stored there. The oceans have absorbed about 93 percent of the combined heat stored by warmed air, sea, land and melted ice between 1971-2010, according to the IPCC report. Image courtesy of the IPCC AR4. Clearly, this large amount of heat that is stored in the oceans (ocean heat content) is one of the most important diagnostics for global warming. (via RealClimate.org). The IPCC AR4 chapter 5 report states that ocean heat content variability is a critical variable for detecting the effects of the observed increase in greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere and for calculating the world's overall energy balance. It is virtually certain (IPCC AR5 chapter 3) that the upper ocean (0-700 meters depth) warmed from 1971-2010, as this is supported by three independent and consistent methods of observation. It is likely that the waters between 700 meters and 2000 meters depth have warmed on average between 1957-2009. It is likely that no significant trend between 2000 meters to 3000 meters from 1992-2005, according to the IPCC report. Updated ocean heat content graph for 0-2000 meters and 0-700 meters. Courtesy NOAA. Warming of the ocean between 700 and 2000 meters likely contributed about 30 percent of the total increase in global heat content (0-2000 meters) between 1957-2009. (IPCC). Two-thirds of the warming since 1980 has occurred in the upper ocean (0-700m). However, there was a recent slowing of the warming rate in the upper ocean and this may have been impacted by the recent prevalence of La Nina's vs. El Nino's (not including this past year) and the fact that there has been a recent transition from older XBT ocean temperature measurements to the newer ARGO float measurements. Releasing an ARGO instrument into the ocean. Courtesy NOAA. If the greenhouse effect or the amount of absorbed sunlight diminished, one would see a slowing in the heat uptake of the oceans, but measurements show that this is not the case, according to a Sept 2013 post by Stefan Rahmstorf in RealClimate.org. Even if the global temperature rise could be stopped within decades due to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions the ocean heat content will continue to increase for at least 1,000 years after we reach zero emissions. (via RealClimate.org Sept 2013). In addition, sea levels would continue to rise for centuries to millennia, according to the IPCC. The heat content of the oceans is growing and growing. That means that the greenhouse effect has not taken a pause and the cold sun is not noticeably slowing global warming, according to Rahmstorf in his earlier RealClimate.org post.

Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, NOAA, Berkeley Earth and the University of York undertook this peer-reviewed study. By comparing nearby pairs of USHCN and USCRN stations, the team found that adjustments make both trends and monthly anomalies from USHCN stations much more similar to those of neighboring USCRN stations for the 2004-2015 period when the networks overlap, according to the study abstract. The results of this comparison improve the confidence of the reliability of homongenized surface temperature records. The most recent annual U.S. temperature anomaly plots from the USCRN site. Why homogenization? A total of 1,218 stations make up the USHCN. These stations were selected based on long, continuous temperature records, rural location and other factors in order to produce an estimate of long-term (1895-present) climate changes with as little as possible bias, according to the report. However, significant systemic inhomogeneities plague the USHCN. These inhomogeneities include changes in time of observation, instrument changes, station location changes, changes in localized station site characteristics and increasing urbanization that surrounds certain sites. The raw USHCN temperature records are therefore homogenized (adjusted) in an effort to remove additional biases caused by these inhomogeneities. In response to the above issues, NOAA began setting up the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN). These stations are sited in pristine environments in rural areas away from any potential direct urban influence. Currently, there are a total of 114 USCRN stations. The research team determined that the period of overlap between the USHCN and USCRN is now long enough to accurately assess the impact of temperature adjustments to USHCN stations using the USCRN as an unbiased reference. Conclusion What the team found was that over the past 10 years there was relatively little difference between raw and adjusted USHCN temperature series in the overall contiguous U.S. temperature record. The impact of adjustments since 2004 was largely trend-neutral. The USCRN and both USHCN series are largely indistinguishable for both minimum and mean temperatures. However, significant differences exist for maximum temperatures. Both the raw and adjusted USHCN series have a lower temperature trend over the 2004-2014 period than the USCRN series. The researchers confidently conclude that the adjustments to the USHCN station records made them more similar to proximate homogenous USCRN station records, both in terms of trends and anomalies. If anything, adjusted USHCN stations still underestimate maximum and mean temperature trends relative to USCRN stations.

The study was led by Dr. Robert Kopp of Rutgers University with the help of several international experts, including Stefan Rahmstorf, who is a contributor to RealClimate.org . Rahmstorf breaks down the results of the study in a recent post from RealClimate.org........ Rahmstorf explains that the team used drill cores in coastal sediments from across different parts of the world to obtain their results. From the findings the team concluded that global sea level has risen more during the 20th century than any previous century going back at least 2,000 years. The extreme rise in the 20th century is a logical physical consequence of man-made global warming, according to Rahmstorf. The rise in sea level is due to the increasing rate of mountain glacier melt and the expansion of ocean water as it expands. The Colony Glacier in Alaska. It is with near-certainty that at least half of the rise in the 20th century is caused by humans, and possibly all of it, said Rahmstorf. Rahmstorf further states that from natural causes alone, sea level may also have fallen in the 20th century. Using a semi-empirical model calibrated with the historically observed relationship between temperature and sea level the projected global sea level increase in the 21st century is anywhere from 24-131 centimeters (9.5 -51.5 inches) depending on different greenhouse gas emission scenarios, which are shown in the report. Rahmstorf explains that scientists have a good hand on melting at the surface of the ice, but the physics of the sliding of ice into the ocean is not fully understood and may still bring surprises to the projected sea level increase.

The two main sources for this satellite measured temperature data is the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH) and Remote Sensing Systems ( RSS ). The satellite database goes back to 1979.

In the video, which was put together by Peter Sinclair, a number of climate experts make comments about the challenges of measuring temperatures using satellites....... How Reliable are Satellite Temperatures. Video courtesy Yale Climate Connections and YouTube. According to Dr. Michael Mann (Penn State), the satellite temperature record has actually been subject to more adjustments than the surface record. Mann also states that the global satellite temperature record has been shown to have a bias of showing too little warming. Studies have shown that satellite data was not properly interpreted. Atmospheric friction slows satellites down, causing them to lose altitude (1 km loss of height per year). In order to derive atmospheric temperature, scientists need to know the altitude of the satellite. Without the correct altitude, the temperature results can become distorted. Satellite drift can also cause problems. Temperatures that were earlier analyzed at 2pm where a few years later being analyzed at 6pm, which made it look like there was cooling, when in fact there was no cooling. UAH corrections were made, but still underestimated the warming, according to Dr. Kevin Trenberth (NCAR) According to Dr. Andrew Dessler of Texas A&M, satellites actually measure radiance and not temperature. In order to determine temperature from the radiance the UAH/RSS team's use a \"retrieval algorithm\", which is essentially a model, according to Dessler. Unfortunately, that model has repeatedly been shown to be in error. One reason why satellite measured anomalies are significantly lower than the surface measured temperatures is the fact that the satellite temperatures are measured against the 1981-2010 mean, whereas the NASA surface database is measured against the lower 1951-1980 mean and the NOAA database is measured against the 20th century average. What should we do? By looking at a longer time period you get a better idea of the overall temperature trend, said Dr. Carl Mears from RSS. Mears stated that it is best to look at all of the data sets (satellite and surface) and not just trust the satellite database by itself in order to get the clearest picture of global temperature trends. It's also not just the temperature database that's telling us that the planet is warming as there are many more indicators. In addition to temperatures, increases in atmospheric water vapor, sea level changes, heat content of the ocean, sea ice etc. are telling us that the planet is warming and that natural causes cannot explain all of this warming, according to Dr. Ben Santer of the Livermore National Laboratory.

The report , \"Green Energy Choices: The Benefits, Risks and trade-offs of low-carbon technology for electricity production\" was put together by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The report basically looks at the environmental and health pros-and-cons of nine different renewable sources of energy. The construction of renewable energy installations will increase the need for materials such as steel, aluminum, copper and concrete compared to the the \"business as usual\" route, according to the report. Some renewable energy installations have shorter lifespans than conventional, which means additional investment of materials over the longer-term. Solar cells and direct-drive wind turbines use rare earths and metals to operate. However, these materials currently have limited or no recycling systems. \"Unless we figure out how to recycle these materials at a large scale this will be a problem in the future\", said Thomas Gibon who is a co-author of the report. Benefits and impacts of retrofitting coal and natural gas fired power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) CCS does cut GHG's by 74-78 percent compared to those power plants without it. However, CCS also reduces the efficiency of power plants as it requires an increase in energy demand of up to 10 percent more per kilowatt hour. CCS can also involve the use of toxic compounds to capture CO2. Hydropower Impacts of hydropower greatly depend on the location of the installation. Depending on the location, hydropower plants can cause the displacement of human populations and can destroy riparian areas along rivers flooded by the reservoir. Conclusions Electricity from renewable sources emits between 90-99 percent less GHG's than coal-fired plants and causes 70-90 percent less pollution. Continuing with \"business as usual\" and without renewable energy use will allow GHG's to double by 2050 with serious impacts on human health and the environment, according to the report. \"Moving away from fossil fuels and coal will help us avoid a lot of environmental impacts, particularly from air pollution and greenhouse gases\", says Gibon. \"These technologies will be critical to keeping global warming under 2 degree C., but we need to remain cognizant of their effects on the environment, such as their higher use of metals, like steel and copper in manufacturing\", said Achim Steiner who is the executive director of UNEP.

The NCAR team were able to determine that the overall winter sea ice extent would remain fairly steady in the near future based on changes in the North Atlantic Ocean circulation. However, winter sea ice in the Arctic will continue its overall, longer-term retreat, according to the report. Observed Arctic sea ice changes vs. predicted for the 1997-2007 period. Image from NCAR. Key excerpts from the UCAR News report.... \".....we are predicting that the rate will taper off for several years in the future before resuming. We are not implying some kind of recovery from the effects of human-caused global warming; it's really just a slow down in winter sea ice loss,\" said NCAR scientist Stephen Yeager. Decadal prediction relies on the idea that some natural variations in the climate system, such as changes in the strength of ocean currents, unfold predictably over several years. At times, their impacts can overwhelm the general warming trend caused by greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by humans. Accurately representing the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the model is the key to an accurate sea ice forecast, according to the authors. The report notes that when the AMOC is strong, more warm water is carried toward the Arctic Ocean, which in turn accelerates sea ice loss. When the AMOC is weak, the warmer waters stay to the south and there is no negative impact on sea ice extent. Predicted Arctic winter sea ice change for the 2007-2017 period. Courtesy of NCAR. According to the authors the AMOC now appears to be weakening and this may be enough to temporarily mask the impacts of man-made global warming and slow or stop the downward trend in winter sea ice extent in the Arctic, especially on the Atlantic side. \"The sea ice record (satellite record only goes back to 1979) is so short that it's difficult to use statistics alone to build confidence in our predictions,\" Yeager said. \"Much of our confidence stems from the fact that our model does well at predicting slow changes in ocean heat transport and sea surface temperature in the sub polar North Atlantic, and these appear to impact the rate of sea ice loss.

Strengthening the ability to recover from climate change impacts. 4. A Transparency system and global stock-take. 5. Financial support for nations to build clean, resilient futures. Climate action will also be taken forward in a period before 2020. The new agreement also establishes the principle that future national plans will be no less ambitious than existing ones, which means these 188 climate action plans provide a firm floor and foundation for higher ambition, according to the report.

New high resolution image of the Earth with the moon's surface in the foreground. Courtesy NASA. In order to quantify future climate change, scientists need to know the transient climate response (TCR) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of Earth. The TCR is the projected global mean surface temperature changes (up to a century out) in response to doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration. The ECS is similar, but goes out farther in time (many centuries). Researchers from NASA GISS have determined that previous studies have relied on too simplistic assumptions when accounting for the temperature impacts of climate drivers other than CO2. One such driver are aerosols. These simplistic assumptions have resulted in incorrect estimates of TCR and ECS, according to NASA's Gavin Schmidt, who is also a co-author of the study. \"The problem with that (earlier) approach is that it falls way short of capturing the individual regional impacts of each of those variables,\" said Schmidt. The team of NASA GISS scientists proceeded to make detailed calculations by figuring out the temperature impact of several variables such as greenhouse gases, natural/man-made aerosols, ozone concentrations and land use changes based on actual observations from 1850-2005 using a very large ensemble of computer simulations. What they (NASA GISS) found was that these climate drivers do not necessarily behave like CO2. Each climate driver has a particular set of conditions that affects the temperature response of Earth, according to the NASA report. According to the NASA GISS researchers, the predictions for TCR and ECS have been lower than they should be, which means that Earth's climate sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 has been underestimated. “If you’ve got a systematic underestimate of what the greenhouse gas-driven change would be, then you’re systematically underestimating what’s going to happen in the future when greenhouse gases are by far the dominant climate driver,” Schmidt said.

It is well understood that the Arctic is warming at a faster rate than the rest of the world. One of the reasons for this is the loss of sea ice. As more sea ice is lost during the melt season, more open water is exposed. Open water is darker in color and has a lower albedo, which allows more of the sun's heat to be absorbed by the surface. Key points from the summary...... 1. Arctic land areas were record warm (> 2 deg. F) above normal) during the October 2014 to September 2015 period. The observational record began in 1900. 2. Sea ice extent minimum during late summer was the 4th lowest on record, while the sea ice extent maximum in late winter was the lowest on record. 3. Maximum sea ice extent occurred on February 25th, 2015, which was 15 days earlier than normal. This loss of sea ice is having a dramatic impact on the walrus habitat by leading to a more dangerous land-based haul out for their young. 4. Thicker, very old sea ice only accounted for 3 percent of the ice pack during the 2015 ice maximum compared to 20 percent back in 1985. Thin, first-year ice was dominant, comprising 70 percent of the total ice pack. Thinner ice is much more prone to melting completely out during during the summer. Arctic sea ice age trend since 1990.

Despite the recent uptick, the Arctic sea ice volume is estimated to be losing about 3,000 cubic kilometers (+/- 1000 cubic Km) per decade. 6.

Satellite records go back to 1979. Cumulative melt days (above image) were highest in the northern and northeastern portion of the ice sheet and lowest in the south where temperatures were cooler than normal. The graph below shows the 2015 melt percentage compared the the 1981-2010 average. As you can see, the melt percentage in 2015 was above average from June through July and closer to normal in the two months before and after. The graph below shows the annual melt extent anomalies compared to the average going back to 1979. Clearly, 2012 was in a class by itself. Last year had a higher than normal melt extent, but not all that different than what we have seen in the past 15 years. However, when we look at the longer term going back to 1979 the trend is clearly upward in terms of melt extent. The following images compare the annual melt day anomalies for Greenland since 2012. Again, 2012 clearly sticks out with the unusually high number of melt days compared to normal. The graph below shows the cumulative change in the total mass (in Gigatonnes, Gt) of the Greenland Ice Sheet between April 2002 and April 2015 estimated from GRACE measurements. Each symbol is an individual month and the orange asterisks denote April values for reference. Image courtesy Tedesco et al. The final image below shows the changes in surface mass balance (SMB) of the Greenland Ice sheet. The SMB is the mass that is deposited by snow accumulation minus the mass that flows away as water runoff. The above chart shows that snowfall has changed very little over the past several decades, but surface melting and runoff tended to increase beginning about fifteen to twenty years ago, resulting in some reduction in the net amount of snow left on Greenland to contribute to glacier flow.

The above process is likely accounting for as much as 30 percent of the ice sheet melt, according to the University of Wisconsin News. The impact of this could be a global sea level rise of an additional foot over the next 80 years, according to co-author Tristan L'Ecuyer of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It was noted in the 2007 IPCC report that climate modeling needs to better account for the impact of cloud cover. This is especially true in the Arctic region, as the rate of observed melting on the Greenland Ice Sheet has been faster than what the models have predicted. The team was able to use two satellites from 2007-2010 to determine height, thickness and composition of clouds over the ice sheet. Combining the satellite with ground-based observations, snow model simulations and climate model data to map the net effect of clouds, the team found that cloud cover was preventing the ice that melts in the sunlight of the day from refreezing at night as the warmer air from the day is prevented from escaping to space at night. Clouds can either reduce the amount of surface heating by reflecting sunlight back into space during the day or prevent heat from escaping to space at night by acting like a blanket. Excerpt from the University of Wisconsin News..... Researchers already know that while clouds can change the climate, the climate can also change clouds, a phenomenon known as cloud-climate feedback. L’Ecuyer is optimistic that the study — a good example of how satellites are helping us solve the complicated cloud-climate feedback problem — will improve future climate models, to help scientists and policymakers across the world adapt to climate change.

It is looking more and more likely that 2015 will end up as the warmest year on record (currently held by 2014) thanks in part to a strengthening El Nino that is currently in the strong category coupled with a warm (positive) phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). It is well known that El Nino has a warming influence on the overall global temperature. A positive PDO also seems to have a warming influence. Based on this and the fact that fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century it is no real surprise that 2015 will likely set another record as underlying warming continues. What I did below was to first show a globally averaged temperature anomaly graph of just El Nino events going back to the 1950s. The start years of each ENSO event are shown for reference. Basically what I did was average out the monthly, global temperature anomalies (via NASA GISS) that were officially included under EL Nino criteria (via NOAA) whether it was a 4 month period or a 13 month El Nino period. The actual plot of anomalies is labeled in red with the upward trend line in green. As you can see, it is pretty obvious that El Nino years by themselves are getting progressively warmer over the past 60+ years. Why is that? A list of EL Nino events in the past 50 years by strength. Typically the stronger the El Nino the stronger the warming influence on overall global temperature. Next, I made a plot of years where there was an El Nino and a +PDO. Despite the smaller sample, it is pretty clear once again that years with an El Nino coupled with a +PDO are trending warmer and the most likely reason is the steady increase in greenhouse gas concentration, which is clearly causing an increase in heat which is mostly being absorbed by the oceans. The loss in sea ice in the Arctic is also contributing to the rapid increase in temperature in that region due to a decrease in albedo. The El Nino Southern Oscillation shows close correlation to global temperatures over the short term. However, it is unable to explain the long term warming trend over the past few decades. The PDO is an internal process and does not increase or decrease the total energy in the climate system.

I highly recommend watching this short video. Courtesy of the University of Queensland (AU) and YouTube. Cowtan explains that climate models do not take into account the shorter term natural phenomena such as ENSO, volcanic eruptions, air pollution and solar output. During the most recent slow-down a majority of these phenomena had a cooling influence on the planet. Cowtan explains that if these known natural phenomena were added into the models that the re-forecasts of the climate models are pretty close to the actual observations during the recent slowdown. Cowtan goes on to explain that some global warming skeptics try to draw attention away from the big picture (longer term trend) by focusing on the short term noise, which is more likely due to some of these normal, natural variations. Some skeptics also like to point out that that if man-made global warming is occurring the global temperature trend should run in tandem with the increase in atmospheric CO2. Cowtan explains that climate scientists have never claimed that CO2 is the only thing that is controlling the changes in global temperature. Even though Cowtan specializes in x-ray crystallography, he has several publications in regards to climate science research, especially those dealing with the public understanding of climate science.

The process by which water is transferred from the ground to the atmosphere through evaporation from plants and soil is increasing the risk of drought with the rising temperature trends. This is especially true during periodic drought cycles that have been associated with strong El Nino events such as we are seeing currently, according to the study. The research team utilized remote sensing satellite data (1982-2013) to record the long-term record of global land evapotranspiration, vegetation greenness, temperature, precipitation and cloudiness. The above data showed increasing trends in both plant growth and evaporation with recent climate change mainly driven by vegetation greening and rising atmospheric moisture deficits, according to the University of Montana report. The report concludes that if these trends continue we can expect to see a worsening of regional drought-induced disturbances, mainly during regional dry climate phases that are linked to the stronger El Nino episodes. ----- Link to the actual paper is below Vegetation Greening and Climate Change Promote Multidecadal Rises of Global Land Evapotranspiration The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"0aa2273528623ec44456a1361f26c5d4f08528ef"}

Some of my own thoughts..... **Natural factors such as the strong El Nino and the positive PDO have no doubt influenced global temperatures this year as they normally do, but they cannot explain all of the warming. Clearly, the global increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration is playing a role and will continue to do so (if not more so) for the foreseeable future. It appears that this current strong El Nino will peak in December or January and steadily weaken during the spring of 2016. However, the warming impacts from this El Nino will likely persist (lag effect) into the late spring or summer of 2016 such that 2016 will still probably rank in the top-5 warmest on record. By the way, 2015 will set a new record high for global surface temperature. There are indications that we may go into a La Nina next fall or winter, which normally has a cooling influence on global temperature. If that occurs we can probably expect to see a slight drop in global temps for 2017 compared to 2015 and 2016, but not as much as we typically see with previous La Nina's thanks to greenhouse warming.

The 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21/CMP11) runs through December 11th. A total of 147 heads of state and government along with 30,000 diplomats and delegates will be attending the nearly two-week conference. The conference hopes to achieve a new global pact that would for the first time commit almost every country in the world to enact new policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG's). A key goal is to achieve a new, binding universal climate agreement that is applicable to all so that global warming is kept within the 2 degree celsius limit between now and the end of the century. According to the COP21 website, the agreement must be universal, ambitious, balanced between mitigation/adaptation, flexible, sustainable and dynamic. How did they come up with the 2 degree C. limit? According to the IPCC, global warming of more than 2 degrees C. would have serious consequences, such as an increase in the number of extreme climate events worldwide. To reach this goal, climate experts estimate that GHG's need to be reduced by 40 to 70 percent by 2050 and carbon neutrality (zero emissions) by 2100 at the latest. Currently, the global trajectory of GHG emissions by published research would lead to a 2.7 to 3 degree C. temperature increase by the end of the century. Of note, we are currently moving away from the worst case scenario (4.5-6 deg. C. increase), which was considered the mostly likely scenario until recently. \"Never have the stakes of an international meeting been so high, since what is at stake is the future of the planet, the future of life\" , President Francois Hollande of France. Other leaders from China, India, Russia and the U.S. spoke on Monday to open up the conference.

Some analyses have hinted the Arctic's multi-year sea ice, the oldest and thickest ice that survives the summer melt season, appeared to have recuperated partially after the 2012 record low. But according to Joey Comiso, a sea ice scientist at Goddard, the recovery flattened last winter and will likely reverse after this melt season. \"The thicker ice will likely continue to decline,\" Comiso said. \"There might be some recoveries during some years, especially when the winter is unusually cold, but it is expected to go down again because the surface temperature in the region continues to increase.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"ded8a8fac9bbe96fcddc749df25c3490d58a4964"}

The IPCC provides an internationally accepted authority on climate change, producing reports which have the agreement of leading climate scientists and the consensus of participating governments. The IPCC does not carry out its own original research, nor does it do the work of monitoring climate or related phenomena itself. The IPCC bases its assessment on the published literature, which includes peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources. Thousands of scientists and other experts contribute (on a voluntary basis, without payment from the IPCC) to writing and reviewing reports, which are then reviewed by governments. (via Wikipedia) Working group I of the fifth assessment report was made up of 209 lead authors and reviewed by 1089 expert reviewers. Below is a brief recap of some of the key findings (with at least high confidence) from that working group. --Warming of the climate system is unequivocal (leaving no doubt, clear, unambiguous) --The human influence on the climate system is clear. --Total radiative forcing is positive and has led to an uptake in energy by the climate system. The largest contribution to total radiative forcing is caused by the steady increase in atmospheric CO2 since 1750. --Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system. This accounts for more than 90 percent of the energy accumulated between 1971-2010. (high confidence) --The upper ocean warmed from 1971-2010. (virtually certain) --The rate of sea level rise since the mid-1800's has been larger than the mean rate during the past two millennia. (high confidence) --Climate models have improved since the IPCC's AR4 (2007). Climate models reproduce observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and trends over many decades, including the more rapid warming since the mid-20th century and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions. (very high confidence) --Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow/ice, in global sea level rise and in changes in some climate extremes. This evidence for human influence has grown since AR4 and it is (extremely likely) that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. ------- In the next post I will include some of the more common FAQ's (yes, there is one on climate models) that we see in the climate change community which are answered by the expert's from the Working Group I.

(from the Sea Ice Prediction Network) Down south in the Antarctic basin the sea ice extent fell below the 1981-2010 average for the first time in four years as the rate of growth has decreased more than usual during July and into August August update of forecasts for the annual September ice extent minimum for the Arctic basin, courtesy of the Sea Ice Prediction Network . These forecasts are updated once a month. The Arctic Sea Ice Outlook contributions this August are based on a range of methods: statistical, dynamical models, estimates based on trends, and subjective information. The chart below shows the sea ice extent in the Arctic for each year going back to 1979. At the current rate, this year's minimum extent could end up in the top five lowest on record. The median August Outlook for September 2015 minimum Arctic sea ice extent is 4.8 million square kilometers. The average for September 2014 was 5.3 million sq. km. The record low minimum was 3.4 million sq. km. in September 2012. The 1981-2010 average is 6.5 million sq. km.

It has been found that approximately 97 percent of papers stating a position on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) endorse AGW, while 2 percent reject AGW. In the study, a group of international scientists developed an analytical tool to replicate and test the results and methods of those studies that rejected AGW. Despite the strong consensus in peer-reviewed climate research papers in regards to endorsing AGW, it was stated that a notable of proportion of Americans doubt AGW (Leiserowitz et al. 2013). One reason for this is that there is a lack of public awareness about the level of scientific agreement supporting the view on AGW. (Doran and Zimmerman 2009) The small number of contrarian papers that do appear in scientific literature are often cited in he public discourse disputing the causes of climate change. This message from these have been picked up by the media, a number of organizations and blogs.(Rahmstorf 2012). Going back to the study, the research team reviewed and summarized differences and common features of 38 contrarian papers that disputed AGW. The 38 papers selected for this study have all contributed to the gap in perception on AGW between the general public and climate scientists, according to the report. Below is a list of the common flaws/mistakes found within these contrarian papers. There may also be flawed papers that agree with the mainstream view, but according to the study, they have little effect on the gap of perception between the public perception and the scientific consensus. 1. Start with a false assumption 2. Executed an erroneous analysis 3. A neglect of contextual information 4. Relevant physical interdependencies and consistencies were commonly ignored 5. Insufficient model evaluation 6. False dichotomy 7. Ignoring tests with negative outcomes (cherry picking) or assuming untested presumed dependencies 8. Misrepresentation of statistics 9. Many papers included speculations about cycles and presented implausible or incomplete physics 10. Some studies claimed celestial influences but suffered from a lack of clear, physical reasoning There were also a group of published papers in journals whose target topics were not related to climate research. Editors in these journals may not know of suitable reviewers (for the climate science part) and may assign reviewers who are not peers within the same scientific field, which makes it more difficult to carry out a proper review. The peer review process in itself is not perfect and does not guarantee veracity (Bohannon 2013). The study suggests that the message from the IPCC assessment reports would be more robust if it also made available the source code and data from which its key figures and conclusions are derived. The authors also stress that science is never settled and that both mainstream and contrarian papers must be subject to sustained scrutiny. ----- The above study ' Learning from mistakes in climate research ' has open access courtesy Springer Link.

Just to recap, large volcanic eruptions can cause temporary (up to a few years), but significant cooling of the surface by ejecting tremendous amounts of sulphur high into the stratosphere. The sulphur then gets converted to aerosols, which block a portion of the sun's rays, resulting in a hemispheric cooling influence. Increased albedo due to a large volcanic eruption. In order to quantify the cooling, scientists have used two approaches...dendroclimatology (tree ring proxy analysis) and climate model simulations. However, these two approaches have unfortunately produced contradictory results. Model simulations have shown significantly greater and longer cooling than the dendroclimatic reconstructions, according to the University of Geneva report. In order to help solve this problem, a team of dendrochronologists came up with a new reconstruction of the northern hemisphere summer temperature in the last 1,500 years that is based on maximum latewood density, which is very sensitive to temperature variations. The inclusion of density allowed clear detection of all major eruptions, according to the report. The new results show that the year following a large eruption had greater cooling compared to the previous reconstructions, but that the cooling did not last more than 3 years for the hemisphere. The second team, which involved climate physicists, used a sophisticated climate model that basically combines more variables than earlier modeling. What they found was that the new climate model simulations showed less disruption in sun ray exchange due to volcanic activity compared to previous climate simulations used by the IPCC. The crater of Mount Tambora. This new study brings the results of these two approaches much more in line with each other. Through this new method the team concluded that the eruptions of Samalas (1257) and Tambora (1815) produced an average drop of 0.8 to 1.3 degrees C. in the northern hemisphere during the year following each eruption. Both approaches now also agree on the average length of this significant cooling following a major eruption. What they found was an average of two to three years of cooling following those eruptions. ----- This study is published in the journal Nature Geoscience.

PhD students Matthew Winnick and Jeremy Caves at Stanford School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences looked into the distant past when climate conditions were similar to today and found that the global sea level might not have risen as much as previously thought, which could mean that sea level may not rise as fast in the future as predicted now. The students focused their attention on the middle Pliocene warm period (~ 3 million years ago) when atmospheric CO2 levels were close to what they are today. Also, during this period the continents were roughly where they are today, which means that ocean and climate circulation patterns are comparable, according to Winnick. The higher sea level estimates from previous research were determined because researchers assumed that the Antarctic ice of the Pliocene had the same isotopic composition as it has today. Winnick and Caves challenge that assumption in their report, according to EurekAlert Winnick and Caves recalculated the sea level rise of the Pliocene and found that it was 30 to 44 feet higher than today. Previous studies put that figure at 82 to 98 feet higher. Key excerpts from the Stanford report via EurekAlert. \"Our results are tentatively good news,\" Winnick said. \"They suggest that global sea level is less sensitive to high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations than previously thought. In particular, we argue that this is due to the stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which might be more resilient than previous studies have suggested.\" However, a rise in global sea level by up to 44 feet (13.5 meters) is still enough to inundate Miami, New Orleans and New York City, and threaten large portions of San Francisco, Winnick cautioned. \"Ice sheets typically take centuries to millennia to respond to increased carbon dioxide, so it's more difficult to say what will happen on shorter time scales, like the next few decades,\" Winnick said. -------- This study has been published in the journal Geology .

Video courtesy of NASA's JPL and YouTube. Globally, there has been an average increase in sea level of 6 centimeters since the 1993, according to NASA's Josh Willis of the Jason-3 mission. However, the rate of increase or decrease is not not the same everywhere. Over 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases is absorbed by the oceans. This increase in heat causes the water to expand (thermal expansion), which is one driver of sea level rise. The other driver is the melting of glaciers and ice sheets across the polar regions. Using data from TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 and Jason-2, NASA was able to put together an animated graphic of the world showing how sea-levels have changed since 1993. The red/orange areas indicate a regions where the sea level is rising, white areas indicate little change while the blue areas show sea level fall. Clearly, much of the planet in in the red and orange. One reason for a decrease in sea level in some areas of the Pacific has to do with the 15-30 year cycle of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, according to Willis.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide growth Latest atmospheric concentration courtesy the Mauna Loa Observatory. Current concentration as of June was 402.80 ppm. Globally, the growth of atmospheric CO2 has accelerated from about 0.6 ppm/yr just over 50 years ago to an average of 2 ppm/yr over the last 10 years. Interesting point made by NOAA's Caitlyn Kennedy is that the growth of CO2 does vary from year to year. In recent years the growth has varied from 0.7 to 2.8 ppm/yr. Much of this variability can be attributed to the changes phases of ENSO (El Nino Southern oscillation). ENSO can have a large impact on the natural exchange of CO2 between land, ocean and atmosphere. Mountain glaciers Globally, mountain glaciers continued to shrink in 2014, losing an average of 853 mm of water equivalent. The last year that saw a positive annual global balance was in 1983. Unfortunately, the loss is accelerating. In the 1980's the average loss was 221 mm/yr water equivalent, 389 mm/yr in the 1990's and 726 mm/yr in the 2000's. Since 1980 the averaged size glacier has lost the equivalent of an 18.5 meter thick slice of ice off of it's top, according to Michon Scott, who is the author of this NOAA article. Hottest days vs. coldest nights. The maps below show the frequency of warm days and cool nights in 2014 compared to the long term average (1961-1990). Days with high temperatures warmer than 90 percent of the 1961-1990 record are considered warm days. Nights with low temperatures in the bottom 10 percent of the temperature record are considered cool nights, according to Muchon Scott of NOAA. The warm days map shows areas where the frequency of warm days in 2014 was higher than the 1961-1990 average and areas where they were lower in blue. The cool nights map shows places where the frequency of cool nights was below-average in red/orange. In areas where the frequency of cool nights was above average are colored blue. Note: the most prominent area for cooling was in eastern North America, while much of the remainder of the world was in the red/orange. Changes in the above data since the 1950's. Global fires Total global fire emissions in 2014 were close to the 2001-2013 average, however, they were 70 percent above average for North America, with the highest increase in Canada. A combination of low winter precipitation, above average temperatures and low summer rainfall was the main culprit, especially in northwest Canada. So far in 2015 the wildfire season in worse than 2014 in western Canada. Overall, the trend of global biomass burning has been relatively stable since the mid-1990's with some extreme years intermixed with some years with below-normal burning. ------- Images and information courtesy NOAA's Climate.gov.

The impact of this is that global sea levels could rise much faster than earlier estimates as the subsurface ocean heat can flow in and collide with the glacier fronts, thus undercutting the glacier faces. This first of it's kind study, which was led by Eric Rignot of the University of California, Irvine (UCI), and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, was conducted over three summers along coastal fjord waters of Greenland by mapping the remote channels below Greenland's marine terminating glaciers.

The scientific method is defined as the process that is used by scientists for testing ideas and theories by using experiments and careful observation. This process is basically a series of steps. In most cases, scientific research begins with a written proposal. If the proposal is accepted then the researchers may be able to secure a grant from a university or government/private source to fund the actual research. Scientific research (preferably peer-reviewed) is critical in determining the aspects of climate change such as the causes, impacts, trends. Scientists are also conducting research on climate change mitigation and adaptation. I found several sources that described the steps of the scientific method and there were several different variations. I chose the most basic description for the method. 1. Ask a question or define a problem that needs a solution. 2. Background research 3. Construct hypothesis 4. Test hypothesis with experiment (should be a fair test) 5. Analyze data 6. Draw conclusion (accept or reject hypothesis) 7. Communicate results ------- The peer-review process...a trusted form of scientific communication Many of the studies that I have been writing about over the years are peer-reviewed, which provides an additional check of the research and results. According to the Understanding Science website, this rigorous. time-consuming process is similar to the steps below..... 1. A group of scientists completes a study and writes it up in the form of an article. They submit it to a journal for publication. 2. The journal's editors send the article to several other scientists who work in the same field. 3. Those reviewers provide feedback on the article and tell the editor whether or not they think the study is of high enough quality to be published. 4. The authors may then revise their article and resubmit it for consideration. 5. Only articles that meet good scientific standards (e.g., acknowledge and build upon other work in the field, rely on logical reasoning and well-designed studies, back up claims with evidence, etc.) are accepted for publication. The site notes that two prominent journals accept less than 10 percent of the research articles that are submitted. Peer-reviewed work isn't necessarily correct or conclusive, but it does meet the standards of science, according to Understanding Science.. ------- The peer-review process information courtesy: Understanding Science.

In trying to understand the accuracy of climate models, the research team led by Dr. Kevin Cowtan found that the way global temperatures were calculated in the models failed to reflect real-world measurements. The climate models use air temperature for the whole globe, whereas the real-world data used by scientists are a combination of air and sea surface temperature readings, according to The University of York news release. The study's findings, which are published in the Geophysical Research Letters focused on effect of the above mismatch in 36 different climate models by calculating the temperature of each model earth in the same way as in the real world (which means including sea surface temperature readings). This study was able to quantify a systematic bias in model-observation comparisons arising from differential warming rates between sea surface temperatures and surface air temperatures over oceans. What they found was that a third of the difference between the models and reality (HadCRUT4 database) disappeared (1975-2014 period), along with all of the difference before the last decade. The remaining two-thirds of the difference over the last decade could possibly be explained by the recent temporary fluctuation in the rate of global warming, according to the study.

Through direct observations the team has determined that glacier loss between 2001-2010 was two to three times more than the corresponding average for the entire 20th century. During the past decade the observed glaciers, which totaled a few hundred globally that provided exact measurements, lost between half a meter and one meter (1.6 to 3.2 feet) of its ice thickness every year, according to Michael Zemp, Director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study. The above results were further confirmed by field and satellite-based observations of tens of thousands of glaciers around the world, according to the University of Zurich report.

The report also notes that intermittent re‐advance periods at regional and decadal scales are normally restricted to a subsample of glaciers and have not come close to achieving the Little Ice Age maximum positions reached between the 16th and 19th century. The large amount of glacier ice loss over the past 20 years has caused a strong imbalance of glaciers in many parts of the world.

Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas. The gas is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term. Cows and other livestock emit methane through the act of burping. This finding is significant since the EPA estimates that methane from livestock makes up 25 percent of the total methane emissions in the U.S., according to Penn State News. Globally, animal agriculture emits 44 percent of the methane produced by human activity. The supplement, which is called 3NOP is able to block an enzyme necessary to catalyze the last step of methane creation by microbes in the rumen. The supplement appears to be safe and effective.

Aerosols are tiny particles in the air that can be carried long distances by the wind. Some aerosols can eventually fall to the ground with snow and cause a darkening of the snowpack. The three aerosols that the researchers focused on were dust, black carbon and organic carbon. Winter snow cover over the Northeast U.S. as seen from a high resolution visible satellite. With their snow darkening effect added to NASA’s GEOS-5 climate model, scientists analyzed results from 2002 to 2011, and compared them to model runs done without the aerosols on snow, according to the NASA Global Climate Change story. What they found was that in broad areas of the Northern Hemisphere (boreal regions) the darkened snow caused as much as a 10 degree F. increase in temperature compared to a snow covered surface without any darkening from aerosols. The result of this would be that the snow darkened areas would have less snow in the spring versus regions where the snow was not impacted by the aerosol darkening. This short NASA Goddard video explains the process. Video courtesy of YouTube. More specifically, black carbon's largest impact was primarily in Europe, the eastern Himalayas and East Asia. The snow darkening effect from dust mostly resulted in surface warming in Central Asia and the western Himalayas. Organic carbon's impact was not as significant and was more confined to southeastern Siberia, northeastern East Asia and western Canada, according to the report.

By analyzing direct ocean temperature measurements, including the group of 3,500 ARGO temperature probes scattered across the oceans, the team from NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) found that a specific layer of the oceans between 300 and 1,000 feet (100 to 300 meters) below the surface where more heat accumulated than previously thought. Maps of temperature trends at four layers in the global ocean show the patterns of heat in meters below the surface, 2003-2012. Image courtesy of NASA Earth Observatory.

Since air temperature over the ocean is closely related to the surface temperature of the water the researchers found it plausible that this is an explanation for the reduction in the global surface temperature warming rate during the last decade. The cooler phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) also likely played a role, bringing cooler than normal water to the eastern Pacific and warmer waters to the western Pacific. Key excerpts from the NASA report .... \"Given the fact the Pacific Decadal Oscillation seems to be shifting to a warm phase, ocean heating in the Pacific will definitely drive a major surge in global surface warming,\" said Veronica Nieves of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. In shorter time spans, natural variations such as the recent slowdown in the global surface temperature trend can have larger regional impacts on climate than human-induced warming. \"In the long term, there is robust evidence of unabated global warming,\" Nieves said.

Are we on our way to another annual global record? NOAA's Deke Arndt recently wrote a story for NOAA's Climate.gov about the past impacts of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on global temperatures and how the current strengthening El Nino may affect the 2015 global average temperature. The arrival of El Nino (the abnormal warming of the sea surface waters of the equatorial Pacific) this year has raised the chances of setting yet another new record-warmest global temperature. NOAA's official records go back to 1880. Arndt notes that we have already broken or tied the record for the warmest 12-month periods on record four times so far in 2015. The chart below (credit Deke Arndt and Climate.gov) shows global monthly temperature anomalies since 1982. The red months are those where the sst's in the ENSO region were more reflective of possible El Nino conditions. The blue months were more reflective of possible La Nina months and the grey's were reflective of possible ENSO neutral. Looking at the above chart it is clear that the overall trend is up, but there are many bumps along the way as Arndt points out. During El Nino favored months the average temperature of the globe as a whole generally goes up. If following months are El Nino favored then they usually end up even warmer on average. The opposite is true for La Nina (the abnormal cooling of the equatorial Pacific surface waters). Key excerpts from the Climate.gov story.... El Nino is characterized by, among other things, a large footprint of warmer-than-normal surface water across much of the tropical Pacific Ocean. This footprint contributes directly to warmer globally-averaged temperatures, in the same way that, if you leave one of your stovetop burners on “warm” the average temperature of the whole stovetop is warmer. But the warm footprint also adds heat to the atmosphere, just like the warm burner heats the air just above it. The atmosphere carries this along, reinforcing, over time, the direct heating from the “warm burner” in the tropical Pacific. ENSO certainly influences global temperatures, but it must be clear that it is not the only natural factor. Arndt points out that ENSO can be characterized as short to moderate time scale in terms of climate variability. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) on the other hand fits into the shorter scale (weeks) of climate variability, while the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) can be characterized as longer scale (decades) climate variability. The AO, PDO and other natural modes of variability can also diminish or enhance the global temperature impacts of El Nino or La Nina. If an ENSO event is weak, or short-lived, and another mode of variability is powerful, the ENSO “signal” can get lost. However, if an ENSO event is strong and long-lived, it will leave an unmistakable mark on the global temperature. It’s no accident that the big El Ninas of 1982-83, 1986-87 and 1997-98 show clear ramps up, and the strong La Ninas of 1987-88 and 1998-2000 drove temperatures down, said Arndt. This year's strengthening El Nino clearly increases that chance that we reach another record hight in the NOAA database, but it is not a guarantee, according to Arndt. My (Brett) personal opinion is that we will set a new global record high temperature for 2015 based on what has already happened and what we currently see.

According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), climate models incorporate the physics and chemistry of the atmosphere and the oceans and aim to answer questions such as when the next El Niño might occur, and what might happen if greenhouse gas concentrations double. Climate models were developed from weather forecasting models but, due to the large number of calculations involved, climate models currently use bigger grid spacing and longer time steps so that they can be run further ahead in time for a given amount of computer time, according to the WMO . The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) put together a short video on the basics of climate modeling. Video courtesy of the NAS and YouTube. Are climate models improving? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tried to answer this question in their fifth assessment report . The complexity of climate models compared to those as recently as 25 years ago has increased substantially, so in that sense, current Earth System Models are vastly ‘better’ than the models of that era, according to the IPCC. Atmospheric model schematic The IPCC goes on to say that climate models of today are, in principle, better than their predecessors. However, every bit of added complexity, while intended to improve some aspect of simulated climate, also introduces new sources of possible error. We also see these new sources of error with some of the newer, more complex weather forecasting models. Image courtesy of the IPCC. When I began my career at AccuWeather 26 years ago there were just a handful of weather forecast models that were available and just a few of those were actually used on a day to day basis. Today, there are dozens of models, ranging from global models to high resolution regional models. The regional models are very useful for situations such as lake-effect snow and thunderstorm prediction. Global models are getting much better at longer range weather prediction than what they were just 10-15 years ago. An important consideration is that model performance can be evaluated only relative to past observations, taking into account natural internal variability. To have confidence in the future projections of such models, historical climate—and its variability and change—must be well simulated. (via the IPCC AR5) The IPCC makes an important point below.... Whereas weather and seasonal climate predictions can be regularly verified, climate projections spanning a century or more cannot. This is particularly the case as anthropogenic forcing is driving the climate system toward conditions not previously observed in the instrumental record, and it will always be a limitation. The IPCC notes that some models perform better than others for certain climate variables, but that no individual model clearly emerges as ‘the best’ overall. Finally, the IPCC concludes.... So, yes, climate models are getting better, and we can demonstrate this with quantitative performance metrics based on historical observations. Although future climate projections cannot be directly evaluated, climate models are based, to a large extent, on verifiable physical principles and are able to reproduce many important aspects of past response to external forcing. In this way, they provide a scientifically sound preview of the climate response to different scenarios of anthropogenic forcing.

According to the report, this is the first analysis of record-breaking daily rainfall events using observational data. An advanced statistical analysis of rainfall data from the years 1901 to 2010 derived from thousands of weather stations around the globe shows that over 1980-2010 there were 12 percent more of these events than expected in a stationary climate, a scenario without global warming. (via EurekAlert) The research team from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research concluded that while the number of rainfall record-breaking events can be related to natural multi-decadal variability over the period from 1901 to 1980, observed record-breaking rainfall events significantly increased during the 1981-2010 period and are consistent with rising temperatures from the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. The additional water that warmer air is able to hold in the atmosphere can be released during short-term heavy rainfall events. The report shows that the observed increase in these record-breaking heavy rainfall events generally fits with this thermodynamically expected increase under global warming. Normally wetter regions across the globe experienced the largest increase in these record-breaking daily rainfall events.

The climate experts at NOAA's climate.gov website have answered many of these questions using the best climate science information that is currently available. I decided to pick out some of the more common questions that I have seen in the comment section of this blog over the past several years in order to help clear up any misconceptions. David Herring , who is NOAA's Climate Program director of Communication and Education put together an excellent set of question and answers. Here is a sampling from his report..... The greenhouse effect. Are humans causing or contributing to global warming? Yes, human activities have increased the abundance of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, which a large majority of climate scientists agree is the main reason for the 1.5°F (0.85°C) rise in average global temperature since 1880. Carbon dioxide is of greatest concern because its rate of increase is exerting a larger overall warming influence than all of those other gases combined, and because carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will remain elevated for centuries unless we implement a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere effectively and economically. Most carbon dioxide from human activities is released from burning coal and other fossil fuels. How strong is the scientific evidence that Earth is warming and that humans are the main cause? There is overwhelming scientific evidence that Earth is warming and a preponderance of scientific evidence that human activities are the main cause. Thousands of weather stations worldwide—over land and ocean—have been recording daily high and low temperatures for many decades and, in some locations, for more than a century. When different scientific and technical teams in different U.S. agencies (e.g., NOAA and NASA) and in other countries (e.g., the U.K.'s Hadley Centre) average these data together, essentially the same results are found. The primary cause is that, over the last 200 years, human activities have added about 500 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, increasing the abundance of this heat-trapping gas by about 40 percent. Today, humans add about 70 million metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every day. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from about 278 parts per million (ppm) in 1800 to about 400 ppm today. Today's carbon dioxide levels are unusually high; much higher than at any other time in the last 800,000 years. The warming influence of heat-trapping gases was recognized in the mid-1800s. Didn't the globe stop warming after 1998, a period when human activities emitted more carbon dioxide than in any other period in human history? And, if so, doesn't this mean climate is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide as previously thought? No, the globe did not stop warming after 1998. While 1998 was one of the ten warmest years on record, the other nine warmest years have all occurred after 1998. It's important to remember that, even during global warming periods, every year won't be warmer than the year before, and there may even be several years in a row of cooler average temperatures. That's why it's more reliable to look at changes between 5-year and 10-year blocks of time over a span of decades before drawing conclusions about climate sensitivity. It's true that humans have released more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from 1998 to 2012 than in any other 15-year period in history, and it's true there was a slowdown in the rate of global warming during that time. Most of the excess heat (>80%) from global warming has been going into the ocean.[17] The point is global warming didn't stop over the last decade; most of the warming happened in the ocean rather than in the lower atmosphere. Can historical temperature data records be trusted? Haven't they been skewed by non-climate factors like instrument changes and \"urban heat islands\"? Our global historical temperature records can be trusted to represent changes in Earth's temperature over long time periods. Different scientific and technical teams in the United States and other countries have assessed weather stations' historical temperature data and concluded that the data are of high quality and are well suited for studies of global temperature changes from 1880 to 2012. Steps have been taken to remove or minimize non-climate impacts on the long-term records. The non-climate artifacts have been identified and removed from station data records in cases where there is high confidence that it can be accomplished without harming the data quality. In cases where there is reason to believe that station data contain significant errors that cannot be corrected, those data are removed from national and global averages. Hasn't Earth warmed and cooled naturally throughout history? Yes, Earth has warmed and cooled naturally throughout its history. For example, increases or decreases in the Sun's brightness would have caused short-term warming and cooling. Also, major volcanic eruptions can cause short-term cooling. Additionally, Earth has experienced longer term cold periods (\"ice ages\") and warm periods (\"interglacials\") on 100,000-year cycles for at least the last million years. A reason for these longer-term changes can be attributed to ongoing changes in Earth's orbital mechanics changed our planet's tilt relative to the sun. Why is the current global warming trend any different than previous warming periods in Earth's history? Today's global warming is different from previous warming periods in two key ways: the reason and the rate. Today, the reason Earth is warming is mainly due to the increase in heat-trapping gases that humans are adding to the atmosphere. And our world is warming at a much faster rate today than it did in the interglacial warm periods over the last million years. For example, The transition from the last ice age to the current interglacial period is estimated to have spanned 5,000 years. Humans could witness the same magnitude of global warming within a span of about 110 years. Another comment that we see quite often is that CO2 is just a trace gas in the overall atmosphere so how can such a tiny amount of change produce such large effects? Pieter Tans, who is a senior scientist from NOAA answered this question in a story from Scientific American back in 2006. You can find the detailed answer to this question right here.

Charles David Keeling. Image courtesy of NOAA. Keeling was the first person to confirm the accumulation of atmospheric CO2 by very precise measurements that produced a data set now known widely as the \"Keeling Curve\". Before the \"Keeling Curve\" it was commonly accepted that the oceans would be able to absorb any excess atmospheric CO2 that was produced by the burning of fossil fuels. The latest \"Keeling Curve\" below shows the steady increase in atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa. Keeling began this extensive survey of atmospheric CO2 concentration back in 1958 when the concentration was close to 315 ppm. Today that level is just over the 400 ppm mark and climbing. The \"Keeling Curve\" also clearly shows the annual seasonal cycle of CO2 concentration that is related to the growth and decay of Northern hemispheric plants from the warm months to the cold months. During the warm months there is a lower concentration of CO2 as trees and plants are able to absorb much more atmospheric CO2 compared to the cold months when their foliage has fallen off and the plants become dormant.

The Iris hypothesis (Lindzen et al. 2001) suggests that increasing sea surface temperatures in the tropics would lead to a decrease in high cirrus clouds, which in turn allows more infrared radiation to be released back into space and causes a cooling influence at the surface (negative feedback). Dr. Thorsten Mauritsen, a senior scientist and Professor Bjorn Stevens, director of the department \"The Atmosphere in the Earth System\" at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology suggest in a new study in the journal Nature Geoscience that precipitating convective (showers/thunderstorms) clouds are more likely to cluster into larger clouds as temperatures rise. This feedback would be a plausible, physical mechanism for an Iris-like response of tropical convection to warming. The inclusion of this Iris-like Effect into the MPI Earth System Model actually brings it's simulated temperature and hydrological cycle response to rising atmospheric CO2 more in line with actual observations. However, other missing mechanisms in the model such as aerosol cooling, volcanic eruptions and reduced ocean heat uptake can be a reason for the reduced rate of warming, according to the Max-Planck Institute news report. Expert response via RealClimate.org. Dr. Andrew Dessler, an expert on climate change and water vapor from the Texas A&M University recently wrote an opinion piece about this study in a guest column for RealCimate.org. Below are key excerpts from that piece........ What they (Mauritsen & Stevens) find is that, even though cloud cover is reduced as the climate warms, it does not generate a strong negative cloud feedback. While reducing cloud cover does indeed let more infrared energy out, it also lets more sunlight in. These two effects, while independently large, act in opposite directions. The net effect is the small residual of their difference. For runs with the strongest “iris”, the model’s climate sensitivity is reduced from 2.8°C for doubled carbon dioxide to 2.2°C — still well within the IPCC’s canonical range. It’s also worth pointing out what this study doesn’t prove. It doesn’t validate Lindzen et al.’s original hypothesis — in fact, it does the opposite – even with an iris effect, the sensitivity does not become negligible. Additionally, there is little evidence that the rate of conversion of cloud water to rain actually changes with temperature, although Mauritsen and Stevens show that incorporating the iris into the model does improve the model’s simulations of some aspects of the climate system (even though it doesn’t change climate sensitivity much). ------ Actual study abstract from Nature Geoscience.

What type of effort would it take to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius or less by the end of this century?

The study determined that there is no time for delay as we need to scale up global carbon mitigation and emissions reductions within the next decades. 2.

The release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere traps heat that would otherwise escape out into space. Carnegie’s Xiaochun Zhang and Ken Caldeira compared the warming caused by coal, oil and natural gas combustion to the warming caused by the carbon dioxide released by a single instance of burning, such as one lump of coal, and by a power plant that is continuously burning fuel. The team found that the heat caused by the burning of a lump of coal was exceeded by the warming due to the release of CO2 from that same piece of coal in just 34 days. For oil it was 45 days and for a single instance of burning natural gas it was 59 days. Key excerpt from the Carnegie Science report... Caldeira explained: “If a power plant is burning continuously, within 3 to 5 months, depending on the type of power plant, the CO2 from the power plant is doing more to heat the Earth than the fires in its boiler. As time goes on, the rate of burning in the power plant stays the same, but the CO2 accumulates, so by the end of the year, the greenhouse gases will be heating the Earth much more than the direct emissions from the power plant.” Especially in urban areas, heat emissions from combustion are not negligible. However, CO2 caused warming (due to trapping of heat) is just that much greater, which drives home the urgency of cutting emissions immediately, according to Zhang.

The earlier IPCC report had stated that the rate of warming between 1998-2012 was markedly lower than that from 1951-2012. This new NOAA report found that the rate of warming over the past 15 years is at least as great as the last half of the 20th century. Thus the idea of a slowdown in the increase in global surface temperatures is not supported. Image courtesy of NOAA. “Our new analysis suggests that the apparent hiatus may have been largely the result of limitations in past datasets, and that the rate of warming over the first 15 years of this century has, in fact, been as fast or faster than that seen over the last half of the 20th century,\" said Thomas R. Karl, LHD, Director, NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. (from NOAA) So what changed? --The last two years (2013/2014) were added into the longer term trend. --Improvements were made to the quality of the observed temperature record (new analysis). --Improvements made to the calculation of trends. --Improved versions of both sea surface temperature and land surface air temperature datasets. --Improved spatial coverage in many regions, including the Arctic by integrating dozens of datasets, including NOAA's GHCN. --The researchers made a correction that accounts for the difference in data collected from buoys and ship based data. Most of the ocean surface temperature data gathered up until the mid-1970's was ship based. Since the mid 1970's most of this data has been obtained by buoys, which are more accurate. Data collected from buoys were found to be cooler than ship based data. In order to accurately compare the two types of data (ship vs. buoy) over the long term they need to be compatible, thus a method was developed to correct the difference, which is now used in their latest trend analysis. The above involved more in depth historical research to obtain more detailed information on each particular ship's method of temperature analysis.

The research team, led by UNSW Scientia Professor Matthew England, who is the Chief Investigator with the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, found that the slow-down in warming since 2001 is simply due to decadal variability and that the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations will eventually overwhelm that natural fluctuation. England and his team compared climate models that are able to capture the most recent slow-down in warming with those that did not. There were a total of 200 climate model simulations that were analyzed and then re-evaluated out to the year 2100 based on one of two IPCC carbon emission projections listed below.... IPCC carbon emission scenarios 1. Greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise unabated through the rest of this century. 2. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, peaking in 2040 then declining sharply. What the UNSW team found was that under the high emissions scenario (#1), the average projected warming between the models that captured this most recent slowdown and those that did not was only 0.1 deg. C. (0.18 deg. F) by the end of the century. IPCC projections under scenario #1 are for an almost 5 deg. C of warming by the end of the century and the 0.1 deg. C difference is just a tiny fraction of that number and still well beyond the 2 deg. C. threshold for a safe limit by the IPCC. Under scenario #2 the temperature difference by 2100 was close to 0.25 deg. C. Excerpt from the UNSW Newsroom report...... “Our research shows that while there may be short-term fluctuations in global average temperatures, long-term warming of the planet is an inevitable consequence of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations,” Professor England said. “This much hyped global warming slowdown is just a distraction to the task at hand”. Professor England also stresses the fact that most of the heat (>93 percent) goes into our oceans, which continue to warm without any sign of a pause.

Image courtesy of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego. These losses to the floating ice shelves off Antarctica have occurred over a two decade period (1994-2012), according to the EurekAlert story. The research team used satellite radar altimetry mission data from the European Space Agency (ESA) to construct a new, high resolution record of the ice shelf thickness. They found that the total ice shelf volume across Antarctica changed little between 1994 and 2003 before rapidly declining between 2004 and 2012. Video courtesy Scripps Institution of Oceanography and YouTube. Melting ice shelves themselves do not contribute to sea-level rise, but they do restrain the flow of melting ice into the ocean from land based ice sheets such as that in West Antarctica, which does contribute to sea level rise. If this rate of ice shelf thinning continues they could lose half of their volume in the next 200 years, which would indirectly result in a further acceleration of global sea level rise. Key excerpts from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography UC San Diego article..... “Eighteen percent over the course of 18 years is really a substantial change,” said Paolo. “Overall, we show not only the total ice shelf volume is decreasing, but we see an acceleration in the last decade.” “We’re looking into connections between El Niño events in the tropical Pacific and changes in the Antarctic ice sheet,” said Paolo. “It’s very far apart but we know that these teleconnections exist.

Earlier studies have determined that the amplified warming in the Arctic region has weakened the jet stream across the far north which in turn has led to a more wavy jet stream pattern over the mid-latitudes during the winter. This wavy pattern then leads to more temperature fluctuations (extreme cold winter temps. for example) and longer, more intense cold snaps. A wavy jet stream pattern. Lead author, Tapio Schneider, professor of climate dynamics at ETH Zurich used climate simulations and theoretical arguments to show that in most places there would be a decrease in temperature fluctuations in the mid-latitudes as the climate warms, which in turn means a reduction of cold snaps. Key excerpts from the EurekAlert story from the ETH Zurich and California Institute of Technology..... The study's point of departure was that higher latitudes are indeed warming faster than lower ones, which means that the temperature difference between the equator and the poles is decreasing. Using a highly simplified climate model, they examined various climate scenarios to verify their theory. It showed that the temperature variability in mid-latitudes indeed decreases as the temperature difference between the poles and the equator diminishes. Temperature extremes will therefore become rarer as this variability is reduced. But this does not mean there will be no temperature extremes in the future. \"Despite lower temperature variance, there will be more extreme warm periods in the future because the Earth is warming,\" says Schneider. The researchers limited their work to temperature trends. Other extreme events, such as storms with heavy rain or snowfall, can still become more common as the climate warms, as other studies have shown.

Tambora 200 Years Ago 4/01/2015, 6:33:45 AM April 10th, 2015 will be the 200th anniversary of the eruption of Mt. Tambora in Indonesia. This massive volcanic eruption left over 60,000 dead and triggered a year without a summer in 1816 over a large portion of the Northern Hemisphere. According to some estimates, the global average temperature temporarily dropped more than 1 degrees C. following the eruption. Location of Tambora, courtesy of Google Maps. An satellite image looking down at the crater of Tambora. Large volcanic eruptions such as Tambora (1815), Krakatau (1883) and even Pinatubo (1991) ejected tremendous amounts of sulfurous gas high into the atmosphere which generates sulfate aerosols. These aerosols reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface, which can have a widespread, temporary cooling impact. The radiative forcings of stratospheric aerosols from large volcanic eruptions (grey lines) are higher compared to others, but they are short-term. Excerpts from the University of California-Berkeley report via EurekAlert.... \"An eruption of that size today would certainly have major effects on air traffic as well as atmospheric circulation around the globe, so we would like to know when the next big one is coming,\" said Stephen Self, an adjunct professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California, Berkeley. \"But we can't predict that if we don't know the size of past eruptions and when they took place.\" That information is simply unavailable even for big, Tambora-like eruptions over the past thousand years, he said. \"It is high time for a systematic exploration of all the available eruption archives -- ice cores, ocean sediments, remotely sensed caldera volumes and geochronological analysis of eruption deposits -- so that we have a better chance to understand potential future hazards,\" he wrote in Nature Geosciences with coauthor Ralf Gertisser of Keele University in the United Kingdom. It is now estimated that Mt. Tambora blew out anywhere from 30 to 50 cubic kilometers of material in 1815. Compare that to Mt. St. Helens (1980) in Washington, which released around 1 cubic kilometer of material. About 90 percent of the volcano risk worldwide is located in the five nations of Indonesia, Phillippines, Japan, Mexico and Ethiopia, according to the report. Volcanoes in the lower 48 states --Crater Lake (OR) was created by an eruption the size of Tambora 7,700 years ago. --Super eruptions took place in the distant past around Yellowstone, N.P.

The big question is what impacts would an eruption the size of Tambora have on the planet today?

Latest weekly sea surface temperature anomalies (March 29 to April 4, 2015) Sea surface temperatures in this region of the eastern Pacific have been averaging anywhere from 1 to 4 deg. C. (2 to 7 deg F.) above normal. New research out of the University of Washington suggests that this blob of warmer water may be caused by a persistent high pressure ridge in the northeast Pacific, which has led to calmer ocean conditions over the past two winters. The calmer ocean conditions allowed more heat to remain near the ocean surface instead of normally getting mixed out under stormier and windier conditions during the winter. Basically what the study is saying is that these warmer sea surface temperatures are not caused by more heating, but by less winter cooling, according to the University of Washington News Today report. This area of warmer, Pacific water has likely had a significant impact on the western U.S/Canada winter weather over the past two seasons by bringing in more heat and less snow to the region. Actual temperature anomalies (deg C.) for this past winter in North America. Dennis Hartmann, A University of Washington professor of atmospheric science and lead author of the study points out that we need to look beyond the popular 'polar vortex' term as a reason for the recent cold winters in the midwest and eastern U.S. Possible culprit is the 'North Pacific mode' His (Hartmann's) study shows a decadal-scale pattern in the tropical Pacific Ocean linked with changes in the North Pacific, called the North Pacific mode, that sent atmospheric waves snaking along the globe to bring warm and dry air to the West Coast and very cold, wet air to the central and eastern states. (via the UW News) “Lately this mode seems to have emerged as second to the El Niño Southern Oscillation in terms of driving the long-term variability, especially over North America,” Hartmann said. (via the UW News) The North Pacific mode has apparently become stronger since 1980 and has overtaken the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) for second behind El Nino in it's influence on global weather patterns, according to the study. Hartmann also notes that this blob of warm water is unlikely to be caused by climate change, but that some of it's impacts on the West Coast weather are similar (drought for instance).

Best estimates and likely ranges for global average surface air warming below for six SRES emissions marker scenarios are given in this assessment and are shown in Table SPM.3. For example, the best estimate for the low scenario (B1) is 1.8°C (likely range is 1.1°C to 2.9°C), and the best estimate for the high scenario (A1FI) is 4.0°C (likely range is 2.4°C to 6.4°C). Although these projections are broadly consistent with the span quoted in the TAR (1.4°C to 5.8°C), they are not directly comparable. Image below courtesy of the IPCC. To no surprise, this latest study, led by Patrick T. Brown, a doctoral student in climatology at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment and Wenhong Li, assistant professor of climate at Duke showed that natural variability in surface temperatures, which are caused by interactions between the ocean, atmosphere and other natural factors can account for observed changes in recent rates of warming from decade to decade. To test how accurate climate models are at accounting for variations in the rate of warming, Brown and Li, along with colleagues from San Jose State University and the USDA, created a new statistical model based on reconstructed empirical records of surface temperatures over the last 1,000 years. (via Duke Environment) The research team found that the IPCC climate models largely get the \"big picture\" right but underestimate magnitude of natural decade-to-decade climate \"wiggles\", according to Brown. Image courtesy of NASA GISS. Brown explains that some of these \"wiggles\" have been big enough to have accounted for a reasonable portion of the accelerated warming that went on between 1975-2000, but also the reduced rate of warming from 2002-2013. Other key excerpts from the Duke Environment story..... “At any given time, we could start warming at a faster rate if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere increase without any offsetting changes in aerosol concentrations or natural variability,” said Li. “Statistically, it’s pretty unlikely that an 11-year hiatus in warming, like the one we saw at the start of this century, would occur if the underlying human-caused warming was progressing at a rate as fast as the most severe IPCC projections,” Brown said. “Hiatus periods of 11 years or longer are more likely to occur under a middle-of-the-road scenario.” Under the IPCC’s middle-of-the-road scenario, there was a 70 percent likelihood that at least one hiatus lasting 11 years or longer would occur between 1993 and 2050, Brown said. “That matches up well with what we’re seeing.” ---- This study has been published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The results of the project showed that Arctic Ocean sea ice thickness decreased by 65 percent from 1975 to 2012, while the September thickness decreased by 85 percent for the same period. ***September is the month when we usually see the annual sea ice minimum in the Arctic. The results of this study will help experts better predict when the Arctic Ocean may become ice-free for a portion of the year. “The ice is thinning dramatically,” said lead author Ron Lindsay, a climatologist at the UW Applied Physics Laboratory. “We knew the ice was thinning, but we now have additional confirmation on how fast, and we can see that it’s not slowing down.” The broader dataset and longer time frame show that what had looked like a leveling off in the late 1990s was only temporary. Instead, adding another 12 years of data almost doubles the amount of ice loss, according to Lindsay. The observations for the period from 1975-1990 relies mostly on under-ice submarines, while more recent observations were made using NASA's IceSat satellite, IceBridge aircraft-based measurements, long-term under-ice moored observations in the Beaufort Sea and other measurements from instruments anchored to the ocean floor along with additional aircraft observations, according to the UW Today article. The observations included in the paper all have been entered in the Unified Sea Ice Thickness Climate Data Record that now includes around 50,000 monthly measurements standardized for location and time. The archive is curated by scientists at the UW Applied Physics Laboratory and stored at the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. (via the UW article) The research team found that their most drastic thinning estimate for the central Arctic basin was slower than what was measured by these observations, according to co-author Axel Schweiger. This study includes observations through 2012, which is when the Arctic summer sea ice extent reached a record low. Since that time there has been slightly more sea ice in the Arctic, which is not surprising to the authors. “What we see now is a little above the trend, but it’s not inconsistent with it in any way,” Lindsay said. “It’s well within the natural variability around the long-term trend.” The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"fd1c021e48a9d82f46ceb4fb450110addfb85b5d"}

A likely contribution to this slowdown is the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Image courtesy of Wikipedia. The AMOC is caused by differences in the density of ocean water. Warmer and lighter water flows northward, while the colder, heavier water farther down in the ocean flows southward. The freshwater coming off the melting ice sheet of Greenland is likely disturbing the circulation by diluting the salty, ocean water. A lowering of the salt concentration of the ocean waters causes the water to be less dense and have less of a tendency to sink into the deep ocean. If temperatures are allowed to increase further then this effect may further increase, according to Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. The Thermohaline Circulation. Video courtesy of NASA and YouTube. \"It is conspicuous that one specific area in the North Atlantic has been cooling in the past hundred years while the rest of the world heats up,\" says Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, lead author of the study to be published in Nature Climate Change. Previous research had already indicated that a slowdown of the so-called Atlantic meridional overturning circulation might be to blame for this. \"Now we have detected strong evidence that the global conveyor has indeed been weakening in the past hundred years, particularly since 1970,\" says Rahmstorf. (via EurekAlert) These recent changes found by this research team are unprecedented since the year 900 AD, which strongly suggests that they are caused by man-made global warming, according to the EurekAlert article. The impact of the cooling above the Northern Atlantic would only slightly reduce the continued warming of the continents, however, there could be significant negative impacts on the ocean ecosystem. The slow-down could add to regional sea-level rise in cities along the Northeast U.S. coast and affect the track and intensity of Atlantic storm systems. If the circulation gets too weak then it could shut down completely with rapid and hard to reverse changes. The odds of a shut down are still slim (no more than a 10 percent chance by the end of this century via the IPCC estimate. But, some experts feel the threat is higher, according to the report.

Researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder have concluded that these periods of little or no change in Arctic sea ice extent can be expected despite the significant, long-term warming in the region. During this study the research team focused on the September ice extent, which is when the annual minimum occurs. They found that a 7-year period was too short to accurately capture long-term sea ice trends. Random weather such as the natural ups and downs in temperature and changing winds can mask or enhance the longer-term trend, according to the CU study. Trend in Arctic September sea ice extent. Courtesy of the NSIDC. Key excerpts from the study...... ....even in a warming world, there’s still a one-in-three chance that any seven-year period would see no sea ice loss, such as in 2007-2013, the new analysis shows. And the chaotic nature of weather can also occasionally produce sea ice loss as rapid as that seen in 2001-2007, even though the long-term trend is slower. Neither time period should be used to forecast the long-term future of the region, according to Jennifer Kay, a fellow of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-author of the new analysis. Some commentators tracking sea ice trends have used the recent “pause” in sea ice loss to claim that human-caused climate warming is not occurring; others previously used the rapid decline from 2001-2007 to speculate about ice-free Arctic summers by 2015. Neither claim is warranted, the authors report. “To understand how climate change is affecting the Arctic, you cannot cherry pick short stretches of time,” Kay said. “Seven years is too short.” The researchers, using climate model simulations determined that in 5 percent of the simulations there were periods as long as 20 years that had little or no loss in Arctic sea ice extent despite strong man-made warming. “It is quite conceivable that the current period of near zero sea-ice trend could extend for a decade or more, solely due to weather-induced natural variability hiding the long-term human caused decline,” said Ed Hawkins, a co-author and researcher at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Reading.

However, the gap (error) between what was predicted by the models and what was actually measured was not due to systematic errors of the models as some AGW sceptics have argued.

Not surprisingly, the gap is due to the fact that there are always random fluctuations in the Earth's climate, according to Jochem Marotzke, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, and Piers M. Forster, a professor at the University of Leeds in the UK. The two researchers reached their conclusion through a comprehensive statistical analysis, according to the EurekAlert report. The team also found that climate models do not generally over-estimate man-made climate change and do not react too sensitively to increasing atmospheric CO2 (greenhouse gas). Image courtesy Nature 2015/MPI for Meteorology. Key excerpts from the report.... \"The claim that climate models systematically overestimate global warming caused by rising greenhouse gas concentrations is wrong,\" says Jochem Marotzke. Climate sceptics often make precisely this claim, citing the warming pause as evidence. Yet they cannot deny that nine of the ten warmest years since systematic climate observations began have occurred in the new millennium and that global warming has slowed at a very high level. The sceptics also ignore the fact that ocean temperatures continue to rise as rapidly as many models have predicted. \"On the whole, the simulated trends agreed well with the observations\" \"The difference in sensitivity explains nothing really,\" says Marotzke. \"I only believed that after I had very carefully scrutinized the data on which our graphs are based.\" Until now, even climatologists have assumed that their models simulate different temperature rises because they respond with different degrees of sensitivity to increased amounts of solar energy in the atmosphere. It is now clear that it is not possible to make model predictions more accurate by tweaking them, randomness does not respond to tweaking. ....Climatologists have been fairly correct with their predictions.

In a nutshell, it appears that very large departures from the overall downward trend in September extent are unlikely to persist into the following September. If a given September has very low ice extent, strong winter heat loss results in strong ice growth, so that the “memory” of the low ice September ice extent is lost. If a given September has a high ice extent, winter heat loss is more limited, meaning less ice growth. Consequently, while there can be large departures from year to year from the downward linear trend in ice extent (e.g., September 2012 compared to 2014), the natural tendency is for the large departure to dampen out, so that, overall, ice extent stays on the long-term downward trajectory that will eventually lead to seasonally ice free conditions as the Arctic continues to warm in response to rising atmospheric concentrations of Greenhouse gases.

However, since 1990 sea-level rise estimates have been confirmed by this new research which means that the rate of sea-level change was actually increasing more quickly over the past century than what was estimated by other experts. Graph courtesy of the University of Colorado Sea Level Research group. Earlier estimates showed a sea-level rise ranging from 1.5-1.8 mm/yr over the 20th century. This new study shows that the rise between 1901-1990 was closer to 1.2 mm/yr. But there is strong consensus in the scientific community that the sea-level rise since 1990 has been about 3 mm/yr. What this means is that there has been a larger acceleration of global sea level than previously thought. Changes in sea level can vary significantly across the globe due to a number of reasons. Image courtesy of the University of Colorado Sea Level Research group. Key excerpts courtesy of the Harvard Gazette...... “Another concern with this is that many efforts to project sea-level change into the future use estimates of sea level over the time period from 1900 to 1990,” said Eric Morrow, a recent Ph.D. graduate of the department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard. “If we’ve been overestimating the sea-level change during that period, it means that these models are not calibrated appropriately, and that calls into question the accuracy of projections out to the end of the 21st century.” The research team used new methods to accurately estimate sea-level rise since the early 1900's. “We are looking at all the available sea-level records and trying to say that Greenland has been melting at this rate, the Arctic at this rate, the Antarctic at this rate, etc.,” said Carling Hay, a post-doctoral fellow in the EPS department at Harvard. “We then sum these contributions and add in the rate that the oceans are changing due to thermal expansion to estimate a rate of global mean sea-level change.” “We know the sea level is changing for a variety of reasons,” Hay added. “There are ongoing effects due to the last ice age, heating and expansion of the ocean due to global warming, changes in ocean circulation, and present-day melting of land ice, all of which result in unique patterns of sea-level change. These processes combine to produce the observed global mean sea-level rise.” “We expected that we would estimate the individual contributions, and that their sum would get us back to the 1.5 to 1.8 mm per year that other people had predicted,” Hay said. “But the math doesn’t work out that way. Unfortunately, our new lower rate of sea-level rise prior to 1990 means that the sea-level acceleration that resulted in higher rates over the last 20 years is really much larger than anyone thought.” This study was just published in the journal Nature.

The UKMET results will be released shortly. --In terms of satellite measurements for the lower troposphere, 2014 was the 3rd warmest year on record according to the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH) and 6th warmest according to Remote Sensing Systems (RSS). Records go back to 1979. The satellite records still show that 1998 was the warmest year on record for the lower troposphere. That year was coming off of a strong El Nino. During a strong El Nino a lot of heat and moisture is released from the ocean to the lower and mid troposphere and this usually shows up much more with the satellite measurements compared to the surface measurements. Basically, what NASA was saying in their teleconference today is that the satellite measurements are much more sensitive to the impacts of El Nino compared to the surface based measurements. We did not have El Nino conditions in 2014 and thus it was not as warm as other years in the satellite record. Some of the top climate scientists have emphasized that the year-to-year variations matter less than the background trend. This has been made clear by record-warm years that have happened over the past 15 years without the help of a strong El Nino.

Climate extremes have little influence on climate change perceptions and do not moderate climate change views of conservatives and liberals. The above statement is true for both short-term and long-term climate change, according to Sandra Marquart-Pyatt, who is a MSU sociologist and lead author of the study. The research team, using more than 100 computer models, combined 50 years of regional climate data with just over a decade of Gallup survey date on climate change perceptions. Earlier studies showed that temperature patterns do influence perceptions about climate change, however those studies did not measure climatic conditions as comprehensively as the MSU study.

Robeson, who is a professor of geography in the college of Arts and Sciences. “Average temperatures don’t tell us everything we need to know about climate change,” said Robeson. “Arguably, these cold extremes and warm extremes are the most important factors for human society.” (via the IU report) Robeson's research team studied the UKMET office's HadCRUT4 global temperature record from 1881-2013 to reach their conclusion. Some of the findings from this study...... 1. Temperatures at the cold and warm ends of the spatial distribution (5th and 95th percentile) increased more than the overall average global temperature. 2. For the entire 130-year record in the HadCRUT4 database extreme cold anomalies increased more than extreme warm anomalies, which led to a narrowing of the range of Earth's temperatures. 3. However, over the past 30 years the extreme warm anomalies increased at a faster rate than the extreme cold anomalies. 4. Due to much more ocean area, temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere were much less volatile compared to the Northern Hemisphere. Key excerpt from the IU report... The study also examined anomalies during the “pause” in global warming that scientists have observed since 1998. While a 16-year-period is too short a time to draw conclusions about trends, the researchers found that warming continued at most locations on the planet and during much of the year, but that warming was offset by strong cooling during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere. According to Robeson, the recent strong cooling in the Northern Hemisphere winter months actually aligns with some theories (Francis RU) about climate change, which show that amplified warming in the Arctic region produces changes in the jet stream, which can result in extended periods of cold/snowy weather in some mid-northern latitude locations. “There really hasn’t been a pause in global warming,” Robeson said. “There’s been a pause in Northern Hemisphere winter warming.” ----- This study is published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

Over the past 14 years during the summer months of June, July and August NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments on multiple satellites indicated that the rate of absorbed solar radiation in the Arctic increased by 5 percent. On the other hand, the rate for the globe as a whole has been basically flat during the same period. These results are not all that surprising since there has been a steady decline in summer Arctic sea ice extent over the past 30 years, according to the National Snow and Ice Date Center (NSIDC). The loss of sea ice and resultant gain of darker, open water lowers the surface albedo (reflectivity) which allows more of the sun's energy to be absorbed. The onset of the melt season in the high Arctic is now on average 7 days earlier than what it was back in 1982, according to the NASA report. Excerpt from the NASA report.... As a region, the Arctic is showing more dramatic signs of climate change than any other spot on the planet. These include a warming of air temperatures at a rate two to three times greater than the rest of the planet and the loss of September sea ice extent at a rate of 13 percent per decade.

Prior to a 2011 science paper, it was assumed that only very large eruptions such as Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 were capable of impacting global climate. The LLNL study indicated that a series of small, 21st century volcanic eruptions reflected substantially more solar radiation than previous estimates. It is well understood that the release of sulfur dioxide from volcanic eruptions when combined with oxygen forms droplets of sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid droplets can linger in the upper atmosphere for months, reflecting sunlight away from Earth, which in turn has a cooling influence on the surface and lower atmosphere. The LLNL team, led by Benjamin Santer, combined observations from ground, air and space-based instruments to better observe aerosols in the lower portion of the stratosphere. What the team found was that volcanoes may have caused global cooling of 0.05 to 0.12 degrees Celsius since 2000. Key excerpts from the LLNL report..... Ridley and colleagues found the missing piece of the puzzle at the intersection of two atmospheric layers, the stratosphere and the troposphere — the lowest layer of the atmosphere, where all weather takes place. Those layers meet between 10 and 15 kilometers (six to nine miles) above the Earth. Satellite measurements of the sulfuric acid droplets and aerosols produced by erupting volcanoes are generally restricted to above 15 km. Below 15 km, cirrus clouds can interfere with satellite aerosol measurements. This means that toward the poles, where the lower stratosphere can reach down to 10 km, the satellite measurements miss a significant chunk of the total volcanic aerosol loading. “The fact that these volcanic signatures are apparent in multiple independently measured climate variables really supports the idea that they are influencing climate in spite of their moderate size,” said Mark Zelinka, another Livermore author. “If we wish to accurately simulate recent climate change in models, we cannot neglect the ability of these smaller eruptions to reflect sunlight away from Earth.” ---- The LLNL report is published in the Geophysical Research Letters.

This past summer the global mean sea surface temperature was the highest since the start of systematic measuring back in the 1800's, according to Axel Timmermann, a climate scientist from the International Pacific Research Center in Hawaii. Between the years of 2000 and 2013 the rise in global sea surface temperatures slowed. However, in April of 2014 the warming rate started to increase once again, according to Timmermann's analysis of ocean temperature datasets. The majority of the ocean warming in 2014 took place in the north Pacific, which reached it's highest sea surface temperature anomalies in recorded history by a wide margin (see image below on left). Image courtesy of Axel Timmermann. The ocean warming may have had an impact on hurricane tracks, trade wind strength and coral bleaching this year. In Hawaii, the warming water will lead to higher humidity on average across the islands, according to the scientists. The researchers also predict that this year will end up as the warmest year on record globally, going back to 1880. Key quote from the report, via ScienceDaily... \"Record-breaking greenhouse gas concentrations and anomalously weak North Pacific summer trade winds, which usually cool the ocean surface, have contributed further to the rise in sea surface temperatures.

Postdoctoral fellow George Wang, from Detlef Weigel’s Department for Molecular Biology at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology along with with his associate Michael Dillon, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Zoology and Physiology, University of Wyoming, have described for the first time the changes in temperature variability across the globe. Wang and Dillon first estimated global spacial variation in the mean temperature and in temperature cycling by analyzing more than 1 billion temperature measurements from 7,906 weather stations that sampled from the period of Jan. 1, 1926, through Dec. 31, 2009, according to the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft news report. “For these temperature zones that we historically think of as having lower daily variations relative to the annual variations in temperatures, what we found in these zones is that the annual temperature cycling has not changed much in the last 30 to 40 years,” Michael Dillon explains. “But, the diurnal temperature cycling has gone up considerably. If the annual is constant and daily temperatures increase, areas outside the tropics will become more tropical. This idea of convergence could be a really important thing.” The duo found that daily and annual minimum and maximum temperatures have increased across the globe since 1950. They then estimated global changes in the magnitudes of diurnal and annual temperature cycles from 1975-2013. What they found was that the changes have been most dramatic for locations closest to the poles and far from the oceans. “In these places, warmer winters -- decreasing the difference between summer and winter -- and hotter days -- increasing the difference between day and night -- mean that the range of temperatures, which organisms experience over a few days, is closer to the range of temperatures they experience over an entire year,\" said Wang. The main concerns in regards to these changes are the impact on crops, increasing insect population, higher risks of malaria and altered migration patterns of birds and mammals.

The research team, lead by Stella Woodard, who is a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences, studied ocean sediment core samples between 2.5 and 3.3 million years old. What they found was that the major cooling, sea-level drop and build-up of ice in the Northern Hemisphere 2.7 million years ago coincided with a shift in the ocean conveyor. This ocean conveyor draws in heat and CO2 in the Atlantic and moves them through the deep ocean from north to south until it's released in the Pacific, according to the Rutgers News release. The build up of Antarctic ice supposedly cut off the heat exchange at the ocean's surface and forced it into deep water, which caused global climate change at that time and not a change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. The researchers, however are still not completely sure what impact the amount of CO2 currently getting drawn into the oceans will have on future climate.

For example, the 12-month period ending September 2014 was the warmest Oct-Sept period on record globally and the warmest of any 12-month period on record going back to 1880. --Each of the three warmest (Jan-Dec 12-month period) years on record came on the heels of an El Nino, which typically has a warming influence on global temperatures, but 2013 (tied 4th warmest) and 2014 (which could end up the warmest) did not come on the heels of an El Nino. As of this writing we are still waiting for the official start of El Nino. --Speaking of 2014, the year has pulled into a 3-way tie with 1998 and 2010 for warmest on record through September despite a cooler start. Both 1998 and 2010 experienced a decreasing trend in global (land/ocean) temperature anomalies during the final three months of those years as La Nina conditions were getting underway. As we have stated, this year we are likely trending toward El Nino for the last two months of the year, which would argue against a significant decrease in temperature anomalies for Oct, Nov and Dec 2014 and favor a new annual record warmest year. --If each month from October to December just matches the 21st century average then 2014 will end up at least tied for the warmest on record in the NCDC database.

The USGS research team focused on 50 bird species in the United States. Average temperature changes projected to be anywhere from three to as much as seven degrees higher by 2075 will likely force the breeding areas of many species much farther to the north. Changes in long-term precipitation will also have an impact. Models below project a loss (red) in distribution of the American Goldfinch by 2075, especially in the southeastern states. The U.S. range of many species could nearly double as southern birds such as the desert dwelling Gambel's Quail and Cactus Wren expand further into the northern U.S.. However, current northern U.S. bird species such as the Sharp-Tailed Grouse (shown below) could lose over 25 percent of their breeding range as their prime breeding grounds shift up into Canada. Two particular species were projected to lose over 50 percent, according to the USGS Newsroom report. . \"Changing landscape patterns such as deforestation and urban growth are likely to have at least as large of an impact on future bird ranges as climate change for many species,\" said Terry Sohl, a USGS scientist and author of this study. ----- You can look up the projected changes in distribution by bird species right here.

As many of us know, carbon dioxide almost acts like a blanket, trapping long-wave infrared energy coming off the Earth's surface. According to the study, the atmosphere then emits less of this long-wave radiation to space because the upper atmosphere is cooler than the Earth's surface, just like the top of your blanket is cooler than your body when you are sleeping. The Earth then gradually heats up under this CO2 (blanket), and hotter objects emit more long-wave radiation. In less than a decade the effect of adding the thicker blanket has been canceled by the warmer body emitting more energy. Beyond the the first 10 years, the study shows that the Earth begins to absorb more shortwave radiation (from the sun), which keeps the planet warming. Despite the unknowns in regards to clouds, the Earth is likely to have less ice and the air will become more humid under climate change. Both of these factors (open water has lower albedo than ice and warmer air holds more water vapor) will act to absorb more shortwave radiation from the sun. Key quote from the UW Today story...... “While greenhouse gases trap one type of radiation, it’s the other type – visible, shortwave radiation – that is really sustaining global warming over the long term,” said co-author Kyle Armour, a postdoctoral researcher at MIT who will join the UW faculty this fall with a joint appointment in oceanography and atmospheric sciences.\" “Our results do not change our overall expectation that the planet will continue to warm due to the burning of fossil fuels, but they do change our fundamental understanding of how that warming comes about,” said co-author David Battisti, a UW professor of atmospheric sciences. ------- This paper was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week.

This is by far my favorite time of the year here in central Pennsylvania. Speaking of fall foliage, new research out of Princeton University and posted in the Journal Global Ecology and Biogeography indicates that fall colors by the end of this century could be delayed by as much as a month, but that the season as a whole could end up being longer. The research team determined that the timing of the onset of color change greatly depends on a combination of daily temperature, daylight, tree type and geographic area. Interesting comment from the News at Princeton story..... ...In particular, a delay in when leaves change color could affect how much carbon an ecosystem removes from the atmosphere, which would partially combat the climate change that caused the delay in the first place, said senior author David Medvigy, an assistant professor of geosciences and associated faculty member at the Princeton Environmental Institute. \"When plants have green leaves, they're doing photosynthesis and taking carbon out of the atmosphere,\" Medvigy said. \"The longer you have green leaves, the more carbon dioxide you can take out of the atmosphere. At least, that's how the current thinking goes. So, figuring this out could potentially be important for understanding the impacts of climate change.\" The scientists note that computer models usually have a difficult time explaining the timing of when leaves should change color. However, leaf change prediction modeling was found to greatly improve when data from multiple sites spread over a large area and when tree species were grouped together. The researchers found that the timing of leaf change was more sensitive to temperature in warmer regions. By the end of the century in Massachusetts for instance, leaves which typically change color in October may wait until November by the end of the century. However, up in Alaska there may not be much of a change in the onset of fall color over the next 100 years. The information garnered from this study will likely be used to improve modeling forecasts.

The study was based on modeling the effect of high and low natural gas supplies on the U.S. power sector, which is dominated by coal-fired plants, which produce large quantities of carbon dioxide, which is the main greenhouse gas.

This persistent ridge, otherwise known as the \"Triple R\" or Ridiculously Resilient Ridge has caused moisture-bearing, Pacific storms to bypass California and instead track up toward Alaska.

Short video describing the what the researchers found. Video courtesy of Stanford University and YouTube. Key excerpts from the Stanford News story...... Blocking ridges are regions of high atmospheric pressure that disrupt typical wind patterns in the atmosphere. \"Winds respond to the spatial distribution of atmospheric pressure,\" said Daniel Swain, a graduate student in Diffenbaugh's lab and lead author of the study. \"We have seen this amazingly persistent region of high pressure over the northeastern Pacific for many months now, which has substantially altered atmospheric flow and kept California largely dry.\" The team found that the combined persistence and intensity of the Triple R in 2013 was unrivaled by any event since 1948, which is when comprehensive information about the circulation of the atmosphere is first available. Using the Triple R as a benchmark, the group compared geopotential heights – an atmospheric property related to pressure – between two sets of climate model experiments. One set mirrored the present climate, in which the atmosphere is growing increasingly warm due to human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. In the other set of experiments, greenhouse gases were kept at a level similar to those that existed just prior to the Industrial Revolution. The interdisciplinary research team found that the extreme geopotential heights associated with the Triple R in 2013 were at least three times as likely to occur in the present climate as in the preindustrial climate.

Modeling simulations, which were conducted by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science found that ice sheets and glaciers melted much faster 14,000 years ago when ocean temperatures surrounding Antarctica became more layered with a warm layer of water below a cold surface layer. The team found that this same layering is occurring once again. Key excerpts from the ARC Climate System Science story.... “The reason for the layering is that global warming in parts of Antarctica is causing land-based ice to melt, adding massive amounts of freshwater to the ocean surface,” said ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science researcher Prof Matthew England an author of the paper. “At the same time as the surface is cooling, the deeper ocean is warming, which has already accelerated the decline of glaciers on Pine Island and Totten. It appears global warming is replicating conditions that, in the past, triggered significant shifts in the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet.” The scientific team also found that the acceleration of melted land ice into the waters surrounding Antarctica makes the surface of the waters less salty, which allows the water to become more easily frozen.

However, separating the simulated upper-�ocean warming in the Northern and Southern hemispheres is inconsistent with observed estimates of ocean heat content change.

The 2014 Arctic sea ice melt season officially ended on September 17th, reaching a minimum of 5.02 million sq. kilometers, which makes 2014 the 6th lowest in the satellite record, which goes back to 1979. The average date to reach the minimum is around September 15th. The combination of prevailing wind patterns, ice age, cloud cover and sea surface temperatures play a key role in determining how much sea ice survives during the melt season. The image below shows the September 2014 sea ice extent in the Arctic compared to the 1981-2010 average extent (red line). The 2014 Arctic sea ice minimum extent was 1.24 million sq/km below the 1981-2010 average extent and 1.65 million sq./km above the record low minimum set back in 2012. ** The ten lowest September ice extents (above) during the satellite record (1979-2014) have all occurred in the last ten years. In terms of sea ice age during the month of September, we can see by the NSIDC image below that a majority of remaining sea ice is either first or second-year ice, which is thinner and more susceptible to completely melting out during the summer compared to third-year and older ice. Compared to 2013, we can see there was an increase in second-year ice at the expense of last year's surviving first-year ice. Antarctic sea ice Antarctic sea ice extent has remained at record high daily levels for much of 2014, according to the NSIDC. The maximum annual extent has likely been reached for 2014 and was 1.54 million sq/km above the 1981-2010 average maximum extent, which is close to a whopping four standard deviations above the average. Key excerpt from the NSIDC report in regards to the Antarctic sea ice extent..... A comparison of ice extent with ice concentration trends illustrates that the areas of unusual ice growth are in the same places that have been showing ongoing trends of increased ice extent. This suggests that wind patterns play a significant role in the recent rapid growth in Antarctic ice extent. However, another possible reason is that recent ice sheet melt, caused by warmer, deep ocean water reaching the coastline and melting deeper ice, is making the surface water slightly less dense. While the change in saltiness is too small to significantly affect the freezing temperature, the increase in slightly less dense water surrounding Antarctica inhibits mixing, creating conditions that favor ice growth. ------- Images courtesy of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).

Geography Professor James Elsner, who is an expert in climate and weather trends performed a thorough analysis of data and found that even though tornadoes are forming fewer days per year in the United States they forming at a greater density and strength than in the past. Elsner and his associate examined the annual number of days with many tornadoes and the ratio of these days to days with at least one tornado and by examining the annual proportion of tornadoes occurring on days with many tornadoes. To give an example, Elsner says that instead of one or two tornadoes forming on a given day in an area, there might be three or four occurring. I (Brett) wonder if one possible reason for this (density change) could be the increase in detection of tornadoes within a thunderstorm complex due to radar advances, storm chasers and social media. Meaning that tornadoes that may have been missed in the past are much more easily detected today. It would be nice to be able to read the actual study and see how far back the data went. Excerpt from the Florida State University News story.... Elsner, said in the past, many researchers dismissed the impact of climate change on tornadoes because there was no distinct pattern in the number of tornado days per year. In 1971, there were 187 tornado days, but in 2013 there were only 79 days with tornadoes. But a deeper dive into the data showed more severity in the types of storms and that more were happening on a given day than in previous years. The story also notes that Elsner found that the geographic areas most impacted by tornadoes did not appear to be growing. To sum up, the risk of big tornado days featuring densely concentrated tornado outbreaks is on the rise, according to Elsner. The results of this study broadly consistent with numerical modeling studies that project increases in convective energy within a tornado environment, according to the study abstract.

This study looked at recent data collected by ice buoys (1993-2013) and NASA aircraft (2009-2013) and compared that data with ice flow observations from Soviet drifting ice stations (1950-1987). The team was able to show that the snowpack has thinned in the western Arctic from 14 to 9 inches since the middle part of last century and from 13 inches to 6 inches on average in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, which are west and north of Alaska, according to the University of Washington news report. For observations in the western Arctic only, the springtime Arctic snow depth is declining at an average of 0.27 cm per year or about one inch less per decade. Key excerpts from the UW report... The authors speculate the reason for the thinner snow, especially in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, may be that the surface freeze-up is happening later in the fall so the year’s heaviest snowfalls, in September and October, mostly fall into the open ocean. What thinner snow will mean for the ice is not certain. Deeper snow actually shields ice from cold air, so a thinner blanket may allow the ice to grow thicker during the winter. On the other hand, thinner snow cover may allow the ice to melt earlier in the springtime. Note: this study is posted online in the journal Geophysical Research.

NASA global temperature anomaly analysis, which also shows major volcanic eruptions and ENSO changes bottom (red El Nino, blue La Nina) The scientific team, led by Reto Knutti, a professor of Climate Physics, has for the first time systematically examined all current hypotheses in regards to the leveling off of the global temperature rise. El Nino and La Nina El Nino years typically lead to warmer global temperatures, while the opposite is true for La Nina. Why 1998 was so warm had a lot to do with the super El Nino of 1997/98. Recently, we have experienced more La Nina's compared to El Nino and these natural variations would certainly explain a large part of the reduced warming rate. However, even though climate models do take El Nino/La Nina into account it is almost impossible to predict what year in the long term that there will be an El Nino or a La Nina. Solar cycles and volcanic eruptions The team found that the solar irradiance has been weaker than predicted over the past few years and that the last period of weak solar irradiance has lasted 13 years compared to the normal 11-year cycle. The combination of reduced irradiance and the increase in volcanic eruptions such as the one in Iceland back in 2010, which have increased the amount of light reflecting aerosols in the atmosphere is likely the second leading cause of the warming slowdown. Measured data and model data The researchers found that measured temperature data over the past 16 years is likely to be too low, since global average temperature is only estimated using values obtained from weather stations on the ground, and that these do not exist everywhere on the planet. Much of the Arctic has become much warmer over recent years, but since there are hardly any stations in that region the specified global average temperature is too low, according to the ETH Zurich report . Some researchers propose using satellite data to estimate temperatures where there are no stations. If the model data is corrected downwards as proposed by the ETH researchers and the measured data is corrected upwards, then the model and actual observations are very similar, according to the report. Climate still will become much warmer in the long term Knutti believes that despite the short-term climate fluctuations, which can be easily explained, the more rapid global warming rate will resume once again as soon as solar activity, aerosol concentration and El Nino activity return to the values of previous decades.

Recent studies indicated that this missing heat was likely going into the Pacific Ocean. The lead researchers, Ka-Kit Tung and Xianyao Chen also found that this process was part of a naturally occurring cycle. The authors' state that this subsurface ocean warming explains why global average temperatures have nearly flatlined since 1999 despite a steady increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. The data showed that it is a slow-moving current in the Atlantic Ocean, which carries heat between the two poles that actually sped up earlier this century, which in turn forced more heat deep into the ocean to a depth of almost a mile. The research team used recent observations from ARGO floats, computer reconstructions and older oceanographic measurements to form this conclusion. They found that there was an increase in heat sinking deep into the ocean starting around 1999, which coincides with the start of this most recent period of a reduced rate of global warming. This natural cycle began when denser, saltier water at the surface in the north Atlantic near Iceland causes the water to sink. This process alters the spread of the massive current in the Atlantic Ocean which redistributes heat throughout the globe. Excerpt from the University of Washington News report.... The oscillations have a natural switch. During the warm period, faster currents cause more tropical water to travel to the North Atlantic, warming both the surface and the deep water. At the surface this warming melts ice. This slowly makes the surface water there less dense and after a few decades puts the brakes on the circulation, setting off a 30-year cooling phase. There is evidence that this 40-70 year cycle may go back centuries or more. The authors note that the current slowdown in warming could last for another decade or longer before rapid warming returns. ---- The study was published in the journal Science.

Diagram of geologic sequestration of CO2. How Carbon Capture Works The carbon capture and storage process that Broeker is talking about involves the capture of atmospheric CO2 and then storing it deep underground. The main problem with the above process is that our ability to capture carbon directly from the atmosphere is limited compared to capturing it from factories and power plants. The good news is there are already proven methods of storing carbon underground, according to the Eurekalert report. \"We have painted ourselves into a tight corner.

A secular trend is one that is associated with some characteristic or phenomenon that is not cyclical or seasonal but exists over a relatively long period. Key excerpt from the Joint Research Centre ...... JRC scientists analysed surface temperature data records – which began in 1850 – to separate natural variations from secular (i.e., long-term) trends. They identified three hiatus periods (1878-1907, 1945-1969 and 2001 to date), during which global warming slowed down. These hiatus periods coincide with natural cooling phases – the multidecadal variability (MDV), most likely caused by natural oceanic oscillations. The scientists therefore conclude that the MDV is the main cause of these hiatus periods during which global warming decelerated. HadCRUT4 Temperature Anomaly 1850-2013 (°C) (blue and red bars). Secular trend (red line), multidecadal variability (green line) and reconstructed signal from the statistical analysis (black line). Hiatus periods are indicated with grey bars in the x-axis. Image courtesy of the European Commission. Looking at the most recent (since 2001) slow-down in global warming the JRC scientists determined for the first time that this period was strongly influenced by changes in the secular trend. The team found that there was a strong acceleration in the trend between 1992-2001 then a deceleration from 2002 to 2013. This rapid and strong fluctuations in the secular warming rate are unprecedented, according to the JRC team. Possible causes to these rapid and strong fluctuations over the past 20+ years could be due to changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean, accelerated melting of the Arctic sea ice, changes in deep ocean heat storage or increasing aerosols concentration in the stratosphere.

According to the NOAA report , June 2014 averaged 0.72 degrees C. (1.30 F.) above the 20th century average. Records go back to 1880. June 2014 will also go down as the warmest June for global sea surface temperatures and the highest departure from average for any month with a temperature anomaly of +0.64 C. (1.15 F.). What is also impressive of this record is the fact that this occurred during official ENSO-neutral conditions in the tropical Pacific. El Nino conditions are expected to officially return late in the Northern Hemispheric Summer or Fall. The last time a month of June averaged below normal was back in 1976. This year's January-June period was tied for third warmest on record globally. One likely reason that the NOAA temperature anomaly for June 2014 was higher than NASA GISS is the fact that unlike NASA GISS, the NOAA dataset does not include a large portion of the polar regions. Large portions of the Arctic and Antarctic appeared to be colder than normal for June based on the GISS analysis. I blogged about the differences in analysis methods back in 2010 and wrote the following... GISS is able to extrapolate temperatures for the northern Arctic by using actual temperature data from stations farther south that are within 1200 km. GISS earlier determined that this method of estimation is actually quite accurate (small enough amount of error) in the northern latitudes. In addition, I emailed Dr. James Hansen, the former director of NASA GISS about their method and he responded.... Brett...even though in certain cases it might be more accurate to use reanalysis rather than extrapolate observations, I prefer not to mix observations and models. Sometimes the extrapolations will be off in one direction and sometimes in another. If the weather patterns are such that there is a cool pool in the central Arctic, then our extrapolation is likely to misrepresent the situation. So I don't intend to leave the impression that I think it is accurate in individual situations, but I think that, on the average, it is better than omitting the Arctic, thus implicitly assuming that it has the same tendency as the average of all global regions with data.

Speaking of the Antarctic sea ice, the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) had a nice update on the status of the ice down below.... 1. Antarctic sea ice extent is currently on pace to surpass the record high extent (since 1979) that was recorded in September of 2013. 2. During the month of June temperatures surrounding much of the Antarctic coastal region were 2-3 deg. C. or 4-5 deg. F. below average. The exception was the Peninsula region. Key excerpts from the July NSIDC Sea Ice News report ..... Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are geographically very different from the Arctic, and are governed by different atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns. Nevertheless, Antarctica has experienced many of the same general signals of Earth’s changing climate as in the Arctic, including general warming, ice sheet loss and faster-flowing glaciers. This makes the small, long-term upward trend in Antarctic sea ice extent rather puzzling. Leading theories (via NSIDC report) regarding the long-term upward trend as assessed over the thirty-five-year satellite record are... 1. persistent changes in wind patterns, resulting from increased westerly winds, which have changed both how much ice is formed and how it is moved around after formation (Holland and Kwok, 2012). 2. Meltwater from the underside of deep floating ice shelves surrounding the continent (greater than 1,150 feet thick) has risen to the surface and contributed to a slight freshening of the surface ocean layer (Bintanja et al., 2012). The extra melting results from the changing wind patterns, which act to draw deep warm ocean water inward to the continent to replace surface water and sea ice that is pushed outward and eastward by the stronger westerlies. By thickening, spreading, and stabilizing the polar surface ocean layer the increased melt from the ice sheet edges helps sea ice grow around the Antarctic continent.

The EPA image below shows percentage of human emissions by source. Residential and commercial buildings make up 8 percent of the total while transport is 13 percent. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has an excellent site that offers information on how to reduce your carbon footprint. Below are just a sampling of some steps that you can personally do to reduce your impact... 1. When buying new products for your home, such as appliances, make sure you look for the EPA's Energy Star label below. 2. For heating and cooling your house it is best to replace aging equipment for much more energy efficient systems that will also lower your energy bill. Keep air filters clean. Program your thermostat and make sure your house is properly insulated. 3. Change out your most used light bulbs for CFL or LED lighting which can use up to 75 percent less energy than the old style bulbs. 4. Recycle, compost and use less water if you are able. 5. Purchase a fuel-efficient, low greenhouse gas vehicle if you can afford it. You will also save on the amount of gas that you have to purchase. 6. Be easy on the brakes and accelerator when driving. 7. Reduce weight in the trunk. 8. Utilize the cruise control on longer trips but don't use it on a wet road. 9. Keep up with regular maintenance for your car. 10. Make sure your tires are properly inflated. You can do this yourself. The proper inflation is on the inside of the driver door. 11. Give public transportation a try. If not, invite your friends and carpool to work or better yet, if you are close to work try biking or walking. These things may seem very small in the big picture, but they can add up. The EPA also has the Household Carbon Footprint Calculator , which allows you to calculate you or your family's carbon footprint and then show you how some of these actions lower your footprint. It only takes 10 to 15 minutes to complete the calculator if you wish to try it.

The research team, led by Auroop Ganguly, a climate change expert and associate professor in Northeastern's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, found that the variability in temperature extremes is increasing globally. The study used climate model simulations and reanalysis data sets to systematically analyze this aspect of climate change for the first time. For instance, while each year’s average hottest and coldest tem­per­a­tures will likely rise, those aver­ages will also tend to fall within a wider range of poten­tial high and low tem­perate extremes than are cur­rently being observed. (from the NU report.) Basically what this means is that despite the overall, long-term increase in average temperature, there will still continue to be extreme cold snaps (relative to normal). “Just because you have a year that’s colder than the usual over the last decade isn’t a rejec­tion of the global warming hypoth­esis,” said Evan Kodra PhD'14.

Most sources, including satellite also showed that the Arctic was still above-normal in terms of temperature so far this summer. On the other hand, when you look at the Danish Meteorological Institute's (DMI) Center for Ocean and Ice website , it shows that the summer north of the 80th parallel has been the coolest since records were kept going back to 1958. The DMI estimates the daily mean temperatures in the Arctic north of 80 degrees from the average of the 00z and 12z analysis for all model grid points inside that area. The ERA40 reanalysis data set from ECMWF (European model), has been applied to calculate daily mean temperatures for the period from 1958 to 2002, from 2002 to 2006 data from the global NWP model T511 is used and from 2006 to present the T799 model data are used. From what I have read, the T799 model has a grid resolution of 25 km. The DMI plot of daily temperatures north of 80 degrees (red line) versus the 1958-2002 mean (green) If you look at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) analysis of the Arctic sea surface temperature anomalies for the Arctic and specifically 80 degrees on north for both June and July (see images below) you can see that surface temperatures were for the most part estimated to be warmer than normal. June 2010 combined land/sea surface temperature anomalies from GISS (1200 km resloution). GISS is able to extrapolate temperatures for the northern Arctic by using actual temperature data from stations farther south that are within 1200 km. GISS earlier determined that this method of estimation is actually quite accurate (small enough amount of error) in the northern latitudes. ---------- I have been wondering why GISS does not consider the Danish T799 data when estimating their monthly temperature anomalies for north of 80 degrees, so I asked Dr. James Hansen, the Director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Here is what Dr. Hansen said to me in his email response........ Brett...even though in certain cases it might be more accurate to use reanalysis rather than extrapolate observations, I prefer not to mix observations and models. Sometimes the extrapolations will be off in one direction and sometimes in another. If the weather patterns are such that there is a cool pool in the central Arctic, then our extrapolation is likely to misrepresent the situation. So I don't intend to leave the impression that I think it is accurate in individual situations, but I think that, on the average, it is better than omitting the Arctic, thus implicitly assuming that it has the same tendency as the average of all global regions with data.

Earlier research found that warming due to increasing CO2 was largely confined to the mid-high latitudes, with little, if any impact on long-term temperature trends in the tropical latitudes. This latest study , which was led by professor Richard Pancost, found that tropical sea surface temperatures were warmer 3-5 million years ago during the early-mid Pliocene Period when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were near 400 ppm and the highest in the past 5 million years. However, as most of us already know, that 400 ppm level was reached once again last summer due to human activity. The research team focused on the South China Sea, using a combination of geochemical records to reconstruct sea surface temperatures in the far past. Two out of the three different approaches to reconstruct the ocean temperature records agreed with the results, while the third method only agreed by making assumptions on magnesium and calcium changes in seawater over the past 5 million years. \"These results confirm what climate models have long predicted – that although greenhouse gases cause greater warming at the poles they also cause warming in the tropics.

The research team from UCLA and five other universities also found that climate engineering will not be sufficient enough to slow global warming. The study, which was lead by Daniela Cusack, an assistant professor of geography in UCLA's College of Letters and Science looked at a range of possible approaches to dissipating greenhouse gases and reducing warming, according to the UCLA Newsroom report. The team focused on five strategies that appear to hold the most promise in tackling climate change, and they are..... -- Reducing emissions -- Sequestering carbon through biological means on land and in the ocean, such as improving soil management -- Storing carbon dioxide in liquefied form in underground geological formations and wells -- Increasing Earth's cloud cover -- Solar reflection By far, the best methods at reducing emissions was through conservation, increased energy efficiency and the use of low-carbon fuels. Of the engineering options (above) that group evaluated, sequestering carbon through biological means — or converting atmospheric carbon into solid sources of carbon like plants — holds the most promise, according to the UCLA report. The study's second most promising climate engineering strategy, after carbon sequestration, was carbon capture and storage, particularly when the technique is used near where fuels are being refined. The idea of adding iron to the oceans in order to stimulate the growth of algae, which sequester carbon was found to be the least viable solution because less than a quarter of the algae could be expected to eventually sink to the bottom of the ocean, which would be the only way that carbon would be sequestered for a long period of time. Reducing the amount of sunlight that is heating the atmosphere through the use of reflectors in outer space or cloud seeding was the second least viable approach as the potential impacts on other aspects of the climate are still not well understood.

Image courtesy of Wikipedia. Two of the leading theories as to the main cause for the extinction of large animals are climate change and overkill from human hunting. The research team from Aarhus University wanted to find out if it was in fact due to climate change, humans or both. In their study, the researchers produced the first global analysis and relatively fine-grained mapping of all the large mammals (with a body weight of at least 22 lbs) that existed during the period 132,000–1,000 years ago – the period during which the extinction in question took place. They were thus able to study the geographical variation in the percentage of large species that became extinct on a much finer scale than previously achieved, according to the Aarhus University News report. The team determined that the correlation between climate change and the loss of large animals is weak and can only be seen in the Eurasia sub-region. “The significant loss of megafauna all over the world can therefore not be explained by climate change, even though it has definitely played a role as a driving force in changing the distribution of some species of animals,\" said Postdoctoral Fellow Christopher Sandom of Aarhus University. However, the researchers found a very strong correlation between the extinction of large animals and the history of human expansion. “We consistently find very large rates of extinction in areas where there had been no contact between wildlife and primitive human races, and which were suddenly confronted by fully developed modern humans (Homo sapiens), said Professor Jens-Christian Svenning, Aarhus University. “Our results strongly underline the fact that human expansion throughout the world has meant an enormous loss of large animals,” says Postdoctoral Fellow Søren Faurby, Aarhus University. ------- The study has just been published in the article Global late Quaternary megafauna extinctions linked to humans, not climate change in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

These changes have resulted in a longer growing season, which has enabled the forests to store an additional 26 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2). The research team used satellite imagery, ground observations and instrument tower data to help reach this conclusion. The eastern forest region was defined in the study as extending from Maine to Georgia then as far west as Wisconsin.

Aircraft contrails cover the Southeast U.S. sky as seen by satellite. Just like natural clouds, contrails reflect some of the Sun's incoming energy, resulting in a cooling effect, but also trap some of the infrared energy that radiates from Earth into space, therefore having a warming effect. Detailed calculations indicate that generally the warming effect wins over the cooling effect, according to EurekAlert. Aircraft contrails will only form in areas of the sky where the air is very cold and moist. These areas can be easily identified by the tools that weather forecasters use everyday. Recent research indicates that the amount of global warming caused by contrails could be as large or larger than the contribution from aviation carbon dioxide emissions. Key excerpt from the EurekAlert report.... \"Comparing the relative climate impacts of CO2 and contrails is not trivial. One complicating factor is their vastly differing lifetimes. Contrails may last for several hours, whilst CO2 can last for decades. In terms of mitigating these impacts, air traffic control agencies would need to consider whether such flight-by-flight re-routing is feasible and safe, and weather forecasters would need to establish if they can reliably predict when and where contrails are likely to form, said Dr. Emma Irvine of the University of Reading. ---- This research was published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.

The researchers tracked the popularity of the term \"global warming hoax\" to gauge the overall negative effect of climategate and the IPCC error on how the public perceives climate change. They found that searches for the term were actually higher the year before the events than during the year afterward. \"The search volume quickly returns to the same level as before the incident,\" Goldsmith said. \"This suggests no long-term change in the level of climate-change skepticism. We found that intense media coverage of an event such as 'climategate' was followed by bursts of public interest, but these bursts were short-lived.\" All of this is to say that moments of great consternation for climate scientists seem to barely register in the public consciousness, said first author William Anderegg, a postdoctoral research associate in the Princeton Environmental Institute who studies communication and climate change. The study notes that independent polling data also indicate that these events had very little effect on American public opinion. \"There's a lot of handwringing among scientists, and a belief that these events permanently damaged public trust. What these results suggest is that that's just not true,\" Anderegg said. While that's good in a sense, Anderegg said, his and Goldsmith's results also suggest that climate change as a whole does not top the list of gripping public topics.

These waves travel east to west across the Atlantic during the warm season. Noah Diffenbaugh, an associate professor of Environmental Earth System Science and Christopher Skinner, a graduate student wanted to find out how a warming atmosphere might affect the strength and track of these African easterly waves or AEW's.

I will try to cover the key parts of the report over the course of several blog posts during the next couple of weeks since the report is fairly long with different topics. Climate Trends The last five decades have seen a progressive rise in the Earth’s average surface temperature. Bars show the difference between each decade’s average temperature and the overall average for 1901-2000. (source: NOAA NCDC). The NCA summarizes the impacts of climate change on the U.S. and also looks at what the future might have in store. This extensively, reviewed report was put together by a 60 member federal advisory committee with guidance from over 300 experts in the field. This report includes analyses of impacts on seven U.S. sectors...human health, water, energy, transportation, agriculture, forests and ecosystems. According to the report, observations unequivocally show that climate is changing and that the warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to human-induced emissions of heat trapping gases. Key parts of the report Temperatures in the U.S. have risen an average of 1.3 to 1.9 degrees F. since 1895, with a majority of that increase occurring since 1970. Temperatures are expected to continue to trend upward this century. Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been and will not be uniform or smooth across the country or over time. The graph below shows the U.S. temperature change over the past 22 years (1991-2012) compared to the 1901-1960 average. Image courtesy NOAA/NCDC/CICS-NC. Extreme events The chart below shows the observed U.S. trends in heavy precipitation. (figure courtesy of Kunkel et al. 2013) One measure of heavy precipitation events is a two-day precipitation total that is exceeded on average only once in a 5-year period, also known as the once-in-five-year event. As this extreme precipitation index for 1901-2012 shows above, the occurrence of such events has become much more common in recent decades. Changes are compared to the period 1901-1960, and do not include Alaska or Hawai‘i. Sea level rise The combination of thermal expansion (more heat being absorbed by the oceans) and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets are the main contributors to global sea level rise, which is increasing at a higher rate. Image courtesy of NASA Global sea level has risen about 8 inches since the late 1800's. Arctic sea ice Since the satellite record began in 1978, minimum Arctic sea ice extent (which occurs in early to mid-September) has decreased by more than 40%.

This is also causing the strongest belt of winds in the Southern Ocean to shift farther to the south, which is causing more precipitation in Antarctica, while Australia is getting less rainfall and more droughts. \"With greenhouse warming, Antarctica is actually stealing more of Australia's rainfall. It's not good news – as greenhouse gases continue to rise we'll get fewer storms chased up into Australia,\" said Dr. Nerilie Abram, from the ANU Research School of Earth Sciences and lead researcher of this project. Dr. Abram and colleagues analyzed Antarctic ice cores going back 1,000 years and data from tree rings and lakes in South America. Before this study, Antarctic climate observations were only available going back to the middle of the last century.

The research team from the University of Leeds collected the data over a 3-year period from the European Space Agency's CryoSat-2 satellite mission. This particular mission was able to survey virtually all of the Antarctic continent, including the rugged terrain of the Antarctic Peninsula compared to more sparse coverage of previous missions, which indicated ice sheet losses that were half as much as what was found over the past three years with this updated method. On average West Antarctica lost 134 gigatonnes of ice, East Antarctica three gigatonnes, and the Antarctic Peninsula 23 gigatonnes in each year between 2010 and 2013, which equals a total loss of 159 gigatonnes each year.

This is the first study to use high resolution satellite data to examine wildfire trends over a broad range of landscapes, according to the AGU report. The total area these fires burned increased at a rate of nearly 90,000 acres a year – an area the size of Las Vegas, according to the study.

The results showed that areas which saw an increase in fire activity during the period also saw an increase in drought severity at the same time. The study stops short of linking the rise in number and size of fires directly to human-caused climate change. However, it says the observed changes in fire activity are in line with long-term, global fire patterns that climate models have projected will occur as temperatures increase and droughts become more severe in the coming decades due to global warming.

Below is an excerpt from the opening section of the report.... The publication makes clear what is well established, where consensus is growing, and where there is still uncertainty. It is written and reviewed by a UK-US team of leading climate scientists. It echoes and builds upon the long history of climate-related work from both national science academies, as well as the newest climate-change assessment from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Below are more common questions in regards to climate change with answers from two of the most respected scientific sources on the planet...... Q: Climate is always changing. Why is climate change of concern now? A: All major climate changes, including natural ones, are disruptive. Past climate changes led to extinction of many species, population migrations, and pronounced changes in the land surface and ocean circulation. The speed of the current climate change is faster than most of the past events, making it more difficult for human societies and the natural world to adapt. Q: If the world is warming, why are some winters and summers still unusually cold? A: Global warming is a long-term trend, but that does not mean that every year will be warmer than the previous one. Day to day and year to year changes in weather patterns will continue to produce some unusually cold days and nights, and winters and summers, even as the climate warms. Video courtesy of UCAR & NCAR. Q: How does climate change affect the strength and frequency of floods, droughts, hurricanes, and tornadoes? A: Earth’s lower atmosphere is becoming warmer and moister as a result of human-emitted greenhouse gases. This gives the potential for more energy for storms and certain severe weather events. Consistent with theoretical expectations, heavy rainfall and snowfall events (which increase the risk of flooding) and heatwaves are generally becoming more frequent. Trends in extreme rainfall vary from region to region: the most pronounced changes are evident in North America and parts of Europe, especially in winter. Q: How fast is sea level rising? A: Long-term measurements of tide gauges and recent satellite data show that global sea level is rising, with best estimates of the global-average rise over the last two decades centered on 3.2 mm per year (0.12 inches per year). The overall observed rise since 1901 is about 20 cm (8 inches). Q: Are climate changes of a few degrees a cause for concern? A: Yes. Even though an increase of a few degrees in global average temperature does not sound like much, global average temperature during the last ice age was only about 4 to 5 °C (7 to 9 °F) colder than now. Global warming of just a few degrees will be associated with widespread changes in regional and local temperature and precipitation as well as with increases in some types of extreme weather events. Q: Are disaster scenarios about tipping points like ‘turning off the Gulf Stream’ and release of methane from the Arctic a cause for concern? A: Results from the best available climate models do not predict abrupt changes in such systems (often referred to as tipping points) in the near future. However, as warming increases, the possibilities of major abrupt change cannot be ruled out. ------ Click here or more information from the report.

In the article, Pielke Jr. makes a number of points..... --Globally, natural disasters are indeed costing more and more money. --It is not true that more storms are happening. That idea is more a form of perception. --In reality, the numbers reflect more damage from catastrophes because the world is getting wealthier. --Pielke Jr. notes that the most recent IPCC report concluded that there’s little evidence of a spike in the frequency or intensity of floods, droughts, hurricanes and tornadoes. There have been more heat waves and intense precipitation, but these phenomena are not significant drivers of disaster costs, according to Pielke Jr. Pielke Jr.'s closing paragraph from the article... When you next hear someone tell you that worthy and useful efforts to mitigate climate change will lead to fewer natural disasters, remember these numbers and instead focus on what we can control. There is some good news to be found in the ever-mounting toll of disaster losses. As countries become richer, they are better able to deal with disasters — meaning more people are protected and fewer lose their lives. Increased property losses, it turns out, are a price worth paying. ----- Kerry Emanuel, who is a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was asked by FiveThirtyEight.com to provide a response to Pielke Jr's article. Dr. Emanuel has written three books and co-edited two others along with dozens of research papers on climate, oceans and the atmosphere. In his article Dr. Emanuel makes a number of points in response to Pielke Jr....... --...it’s not necessarily appropriate to normalize damages by gross domestic product (GDP) if the intent is to detect an underlying climate trend. GDP increase does not translate in any obvious way to damage increase. --Emanuel questions the statistical significance of the two graphs provided by Pielke Jr. and states that 23 years is not long enough to detect trends in natural hazard damages whether such trends are caused by demographics or by climate change. --The 19-year global damage trends normalized by GDP shows no significant trend. This likely indicates that 20 years may be too short a period to detect a significant trend. Compare this to the longer (36 year) U.S. record, which shows a statistically significant upward trend in normalized insured losses from all non-geophysical disasters. Key excerpts from Emanuel's response on FiveThirtyEight.com.... There is an even more significant problem with Pielke’s analysis. In a nutshell, he addresses trend detection when what we need is event risk assessment. The two would be equivalent if the actuarial data was the only data available pertaining to event risk. But that is far from the case; we often have much more information about risk. I collaborated with Yale economist Robert Mendelsohn and his colleagues in estimating global hurricane damage changes through the year 2100, based on hurricanes “downscaled” from four climate models. We estimate that global hurricane damage will about double owing to demographic trends, and double again because of climate change. These projections are not inconsistent with what we’ve been seeing in hurricane data and in economic damage from hurricanes. Besides this study, there are robust theory and modeling results that show increased risk of hydrological extremes (floods and droughts) and heat-related problems.

Imagery from the European Advanced Scatterometer shows the distribution of multiyear ice compared to first year ice for March 28, 2013 (yellow line) and March 2, 2014 (blue line). Image courtesy NOAA, NESDIS and the Canadian Ice Service. During the summer of 2013, a larger fraction of first-year ice survived compared to recent years. This ice has now become second-year ice, according to the NSIDC. This multi-year ice is critical to sustaining what is left of the Arctic sea ice later in the summer. Thinner, one-year or less ice is much more susceptible to complete loss by the end of the melt season. The multi-year ice in the Arctic Basin increased from 2.25 to 3.17 million square kilometers during the year. Multi-year sea ice made up a total of 30% of the Arctic icepack the previous compared to 43% this winter. However, the experts at the NSIDC explain that one of the reasons for this increase may be due to the more extensive ice cover in September 2013 compared to the very low extent of September 2012. Despite the above increase, the longer-term trend since the late 1980's shows a clear decrease in mult-year ice.

Both the Royal Society and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences have teamed up to explain the physical aspects of climate change in their report , which is titled ' Climate Change, Evidence and Causes ' Short introductory video from professor Eric Wolff and the Royal Society. Video courtesy of YouTube. Some of the main points from the report...... --More certain than ever that climate change is happening. --Humans are changing Earth's climate. --Evidence is clear, but not every single detail is ever totally settled or completely certain. --Atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased 40% since start of industrial revolution with half of that increase occurring after 1970. --Slowdowns and accelerations in warming lasting a decade or more will continue to occur. Here is a sampling of some of the most common questions about climate change and the answers from this panel of experts.... Q: How do scientists know that recent climate change is largely caused by human activities? A: Scientists know that recent climate change is largely caused by human activities from an understanding of basic physics, comparing observations with models, and fingerprinting the detailed patterns of climate change caused by different human and natural influences. Q: Does the rate of warming vary from one decade to another? A: Yes. The observed warming rate has varied from year to year, decade to decade, and place to place, as is expected from our understanding of the climate system. These shorter-term variations are mostly due to natural causes, and do not contradict our fundamental understanding that the long-term warming trend is primarily due to human-induced changes in the atmospheric levels of CO2and other greenhouse gases. Q: Does the recent slowdown of warming mean that climate change is no longer happening? A; No. Since the very warm year 1998 that followed the strong 1997-98 El Niño, the increase in average surface temperature has slowed relative to the previous decade of rapid temperature increases. Despite the slower rate of warming the 2000s were warmer than the 1990s. A short-term slowdown in the warming of Earth’s surface does not invalidate our understanding of long-term changes in global temperature arising from human-induced changes in greenhouse gases. Q: Why is Arctic sea ice decreasing while Antarctic sea ice is not? A: Sea ice extent is affected by winds and ocean currents as well as temperature. Sea ice in the partly-enclosed Arctic Ocean seems to be responding directly to warming, while changes in winds and in the ocean seem to be dominating the patterns of climate and sea ice change in the ocean around Antarctica. -------- Key contributors to this peer-reviewed report.

Ancient Polytrichum mosses that have been trapped under the ice for thousands of years on Baffin Island in northern Canada are becoming exposed due to the warming temperatures that is melting the ice. Since the moss samples would have been destroyed by erosion had they been previously exposed, the authors of a new study suggest that the temperatures in the Arctic now must be warmer than during any sustained period since the mosses were originally buried. Polytrichum moss Scientists from the University of Colorado then radiocarbon dated these ancient moss and found that most of the samples date from the past 5,000 years, when a period of strong cooling took place in the Arctic. However, the team also found much older samples that ranged in age from 24,000 to 44,000 years old.

The study, which was just published in the journal Science, notes that there are still many unknowns about the key interaction between aerosols and clouds, which can counteract part of the effects of climate warming by increasing the amount of sunlight that is reflected back to space. Interaction of clouds and aerosols on sunlight Aerosols are small particles that float in the air and can be caused by dust, pollution and greenhouse gases. Key excerpt from the EurekAlert report, The ways in which these aerosols affect climate through their interaction with clouds are complex and incompletely captured by climate models, say the researchers. As a result, the radiative forcing (that is, the disturbance to the earth's \"energy budget\" from the sun) caused by human activities is highly uncertain, making it difficult to predict the extent of global warming. Lead author, Prof. Daniel Rosenfeld of the Fredy and Nadine Herrmann Institute of Earth Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem notes that while advances have led to a more detailed understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions and their effects on climate, further progress is hampered by limited observational capabilities and coarse climate models. Also, little is is known about the unperturbed aerosol level that existed in the preindustrial era. Explicit computer simulations of these processes even at the scale of a whole cloud or multi-cloud system, let alone that of the planet, require hundreds of hours on the most powerful computers available. Therefore, a sufficiently accurate simulation of these processes at a global scale is still impractical. There have been recent groundbreaking model simulations in regards to cloud-aerosol interactions, which may lead to model runs on a global scale going out several years. However, climate simulations on a scale of a century are still not feasible, according to the report.

Statement from the report....... The recent slowdown of global warming is a consequence of both a slowdown in the growth rate of climate forcings and recent ENSO history. Given that the tropical Pacific seems to be moving toward the next El Niño, record global temperature is likely in the near term. However, the rate of future warming will depend upon changes of the tropospheric aerosol forcing, which is highly uncertain and unmeasured. Key points from the report......... --Rate of global warming was slower in the past decade than the prior three decades. --Likely reasons for the reduced rate of warming are slower growth of net climate forcings and cooling in the tropical Pacific Ocean. --Continued trend of increasing frequency of extreme hot summer anomalies over land continued despite Pacific cooling. --There is a substantial likelihood of an El Nino beginning in 2014, which would probably result in a record high global temperature for 2015. --The 14 warmest years in the GISS record going back to 1880 have all occurred since and including 1998. --Weakening of a weak La Nina like cooling of the equatorial eastern Pacific during the Fall helped contribute to 2013 having the 2nd warmest Sep-Nov in the 134-year record. --Leveling off of global temperatures from 1940-1975 is generally attributed to an approximate balance of aerosol cooling and greenhouse gas warming during a period of rapid growth of fossil fuel use with little air pollution control. However, this not a given due to the lack of actual aerosol measurements. --Despite the first 3-years of the present decade averaging about the same in terms of temperature compared to the previous decade, we have high confidence that the present decade as a whole will still end up warmer than the previous decade due to the fact that the planet is out of energy balance. That is, more energy coming in compared to going out. This is mainly due to increasing greenhouse gases over century, which are expected to further increase. --Large volcanic eruptions are always a wildcard and can lead to significant, short-term cooling. Key excerpts from the report..... In contrast, winter temperature over land has declined in the past 10 years. There has been recent speculation that observed loss of Arctic sea ice may spur winter cold air outbreaks. On the other hand, Fig. 6a shows that there have been large oscillations in winter land temperature in the past when large Arctic sea ice reductions are not known to have occurred and seem unlikely, although accurate sea ice data are not available for those earlier times. Kosaka and Xie simulations suggest that the recent winter cooling is more a consequence of tropical ocean temperatures. Climate models yield larger long-term warming in winter than in summer, even when considering only land areas. Thus the recent downturn of winter temperature over Northern Hemisphere land is unlikely to continue. We conclude that solar forcing is not negligible and contributed modestly to the global warming slowdown in the past decade, but its effect was small 16 and overwhelmed by long-term growth of GHGs, as confirmed by the fact that Earth was out of energy balance, more energy coming in than going out, even during the deep 2005-2010 solar minimum. We conclude that a slowdown of the growth rate of the net climate forcing probably contributed to the slowdown of global warming in the past 15 years. The slower increase of climate forcing cannot by itself account for a long global temperature standstill, because we know that the planet continued to be well out of energy balance, more energy coming in from the sun than energy radiated to space. The dynamic variability of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature, i.e., the ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation), 2 can play a significant role on temperature change over a decade and it has a dominant role in interannual fluctuations.

Trend in January Arctic sea ice extent. The European Space Agency (ESA) launched a satellite (CryoSat) in 2010 which is able to provide improved estimates of sea ice thickness and volume.

The latest Arctic sea ice extent compared to normal. -Arctic sea ice volume in the autumn of 2013 was 50 percent higher than the autumn of 2012. -It is estimated that about 90 percent of the increase in volume is due to retention of thick, multi-year ice around northern Greenland and northern Canada.

This sudden increase in trade winds has driven more of the heat into the oceans. However, when the winds eventually slow down we can expect a more sudden rise in average global temperatures, according to researchers from the University of New South Wales. The strengthening of the Pacific trade winds began in the 1990's and continues today, according to the study, which was posted in ScienceDaily. . Climate models did not account for this amount of strengthening of the trade winds and thus were too warm with their projections. However, once this data was incorporated into the modeling the global average temperature output closely resembled actual observations over the past 13 years. Key excerpts from the report, which was published in the journal Nature Climate Change...... The impact of the trade winds on global average temperatures is caused by the winds forcing heat to accumulate below surface of the Western Pacific Ocean. \"This pumping of heat into the ocean is not very deep, however, and once the winds abate, heat is returned rapidly to the atmosphere,\" explains Prof. Matthew England, who is the lead author of the study. \"We should be very clear: the current hiatus offers no comfort -- we are just seeing another pause in warming before the next inevitable rise in global temperatures,\" says England.

I realize it is hard to believe for folks in the eastern half of the U.S. and Canada, but January 2014 was the 3rd warmest January in the GISS global temperature record, which goes back to 1880. The top two warmest January months were 2002 and 2003 in which both years averaged 0.72 degrees above normal. Global temperature anomalies for January 2014. Image courtesy of GISS. You can clearly see how warm it was compared to normal last month over western Canada and Alaska, while a large portion of eastern North America shivered. January 2014 averaged 0.70 degrees C. (1.26 degrees F.) above the 1951-1980 average, according to GISS. January 2014 was also the 3rd warmest January in the Northern Hemisphere and averaged 0.94 C. (1.69 F.) above normal. In the Southern Hemisphere, last month was the 8th warmest January on record with a temperature anomaly of +0.47 C. (+0.85 F.) ----- Key FAQ's from the GISS site......... Q . Why no data from before 1880? A . The analysis is limited to the period since 1880 because of poor spatial coverage of stations and decreasing data quality prior to that time. Meteorological station data provide a useful indication of temperature change in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics for a few decades prior to 1880, and there are a small number of station records that extend back to previous centuries. However, we believe that analyses for these earlier years need to be carried out on a station by station basis with an attempt to discern the method and reliability of measurements at each station, a task beyond the scope of our analysis. Global studies of still earlier times depend upon incorporation of proxy measures of temperature change. Q . Why use the adjusted rather than the \"raw\" data? A . GISS uses temperature data for longterm climate studies. For station data to be useful for such studies, it is essential that the time series of observations are consistent, and that any non-climatic temperature jumps, introduced by station moves or equipment updates, are corrected for. In adjusted data the effect of such non-climatic influences is eliminated whenever possible. Originally, only documented cases were adjusted, however the current procedure used by NOAA/NCDC applies an automated system that uses systematic comparisons with neighboring stations to deal with undocumented instances of artificial changes. The processes and evaluation of these procedures are described in numerous publications — for instance, Menne et al., 2010 and Venema et al., 2012 — and at the NOAA/NCDC website. Q . Why stick with the 1951-1980 base period? A . The primary focus of the GISS analysis are longterm temperature changes over many decades and centuries, and a fixed base period makes the anomalies consistent over time. However, organizations like the NWS who are more focused on current weather conditions work with a time frame of days, weeks, or at most a few years. In that situation it makes sense to move the base period occasionally, i.e. pick a new normal, so that roughly half the data of interest are above normal and the rest below.

The recent 'slow-down' of global warming is partly due to an increase of volcanic aerosols into the stratosphere during this century, according to the new research from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. \"This (increase in aerosols) has created a natural cooling of the planet and has partly offset the increase in surface and atmospheric temperatures due to human influence,\" said Lawrence Livermore climate scientist Benjamin Santer, who serves as lead author of the study. Volcanic eruptions spew sulfur dioxide gas into the atmosphere. Large eruptions can send the gas high into the stratosphere where the gas forms tiny droplets of sulphuric acid (aerosol), which reflect a portion of incoming sunlight back into space and leads to a cooling influence in the lower atmosphere. Another excerpt from the LLNL study about how they came up with their conclusion... The researchers performed two different statistical tests to determine whether recent volcanic eruptions have cooling effects that can be distinguished from the intrinsic variability of the climate. The team found evidence for significant correlations between volcanic aerosol observations and satellite-based estimates of lower tropospheric temperatures as well as the sunlight reflected back to space by the aerosol particles. ------- I will say that it seems like we there has been an uptick in volcanic activity over the past decade, though I do not readily have the data to support that. However, I know a lot depends on the volume of emissions and how high it gets up into the atmosphere. It is a fact that major eruptions that eject a large volume of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere and especially those located in the tropical regions can produce a sudden, but significant drop (negative forcing) in global temperature for a short period of time.

However, last decade was still the warmest decade on record going back to 1880. Has global warming stopped? Greater than 90 percent of the heat that reaches the earth's surface goes into the oceans. Over the last decade, more than 30 percent of that heat has reached below the 700 meter depth in the oceans, which is traceable to changes in surface winds mainly over the Pacific Ocean, which has been associated with a switch to the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 1999. Surface warming was much more evident during the positive phase of the PDO during the 1976-1998 period as less heat was absorbed by the deeper part of the oceans. A new research paper shows that natural variability modulates the rate of surface temperature change, while sea level continues a steady increase. There is no pause in global warming, it is just manifested in different ways, according to Kevin Trenberth who is a co-author of the study. According to the study, the biggest fluctuations in global mean surface temperature have been identified with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The major El Nino event back in 1997-98 was likely a trigger for the change in the PDO, as it led to a large loss of heat in the deep Pacific. The PDO can lock into one phase for as much as 25-30 years. Key excerpts from the study titled \"An apparent hiatus in global warming\" Deniers of climate change often cherry-pick points on time series and seize on the El Niño warm year of 1998 as the start of the hiatus in global mean temperature rise (Figure 6). This turns out, arguably, to have been the transition time from a positive to a negative phase of the PDO. The monthly time series (Figure 8) readily reveals the multidecadal regimes of the PDO (given by the black line) with positive phases from 1923 to 1942 and 1976 to 1998, and negative phases from 1943 to 1976 and after 1999. While naturally emphasizing the North Pacific, the pattern covers the entire Pacific with a somewhat ENSO-like pattern but one that is broader in the tropics [Chen et al., 2008]. If we now examine the hiatus period of 1999–2012 and compare it to the time when global warming really took off from 1976 to 1998 (Figure 9), the negative PDO pattern emerges very strongly throughout the Pacific although warming prevails in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and on land. In other words, it is the central and eastern Pacific more than anywhere else that has not warmed in the past decade or so. In spite of some cold European winters, Europe does not standout in Figure 9 and instead is a warm region. The AMO is positive (Figure 7) and is revealed in Figure 9 to be part of a wider warming. Variations in natural external forcings are not an explanation of the hiatus, but rather internal variations within the climate system are keys, according to the researchers. The PDO is essentially a natural mode of variability, although there are questions about how it is affected by the warming climate, and so the plateau in warming is not because global warming has ceased. The evidence supports continued heating of the climate system as manifested by melting of Arctic sea ice and glaciers, as well as Greenland, but most of the heat is going into the oceans and increasingly into the deep ocean, and thus contributes to sea-level rise. The analysis in this article does not suggest that global warming has disappeared; on the contrary, it is very much alive but being manifested in somewhat different ways than a simple increase in global mean surface temperature.

New research out of Australia has shown that climate models indicating a low temperature response to a doubling of carbon dioxide from preindustrial times are not reproducing the correct processes that lead to cloud formation. Short video below explains the results of this new study. Courtesy to the UNSW and YouTube. There are still many unanswered questions as to whether cloud formation will have a positive or negative temperature affect on global warming. This most recent study from the University of New South Wales’ Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science shows that when the processes of water vapor evaporation up into the atmosphere are corrected in the climate model it produces cycles that take water vapor to a wider range of heights in the atmosphere, causing fewer clouds to form in a warmer climate. This increases the amount of sunlight and heat entering the atmosphere and increases the sensitivity of our climate to carbon dioxide or any other perturbation, according to Eurekalert. The research team concluded that there would be less low cloud formation as the Earth warms up due to this mixing process, which pulls moisture away from the level where these clouds typically form. “When the processes are correct in the climate models the level of climate sensitivity is far higher. Previously estimates of the sensitivity of global temperature to a doubling of carbon dioxide ranged from 1.5°C to 5°C. This new research takes away the lower end of climate sensitivity estimates, meaning that global average temperatures will increase by 3°C to 5°C with a doubling of carbon dioxide,' according to lead-author Prof. Steven Sherwood from the University of New South Wales. Based on this study, Global average temperatures will rise at least 4°C by 2100 and potentially more than 8°C by 2200 if carbon dioxide emissions are not reduced. “Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong, and we are the first to admit they are not perfect, but what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by those models which predict less warming, not those that predict more,” said Prof. Sherwood. ------- This study was recently published in the journal Nature.

Key excerpts from the NSIDC report.... Summer weather patterns during 2013 were very different from those seen in 2007 to 2012. Overall it was considerably cooler. There was little evidence of the summer dipole pattern seen in recent years. Relatively cool conditions also characterized the Greenland Ice Sheet, and surface melt was much less extensive than for 2012.

In Antarctica, sea ice extent has been well above average, setting record extents for both the summer minimum and winter maximum. For a long period over the winter and spring months, ice extent was at a record for the modern satellite era. While remarkable, it is important to note that trends in Antarctic sea ice extent remain small (1 to 4%) and are statistically significant relative to inter-annual variation only for the late autumn, winter, and early spring months. Early satellite records (the Nimbus satellite series in 1964, 1966, and 1969) provide further evidence that Antarctic sea ice extent is highly variable; the three years covered by Nimbus show September extents that were both higher and lower than seen in the modern continuous, calibrated satellite record.

The research team showed how the Earth's water cycle responds differently to heating by sunlight than it does to warming due to a stronger greenhouse effect. Excerpt from the European Geosciences Union article......... “These different responses to surface heating are easy to explain,” says Axel Kleidon of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry who uses a pot on the kitchen stove as an analogy. “The temperature in the pot is increased by putting on a lid or by turning up the heat – but these two cases differ by how much energy flows through the pot,” he says. A stronger greenhouse effect puts a thicker ‘lid’ over the Earth’s surface but, if there is no additional sunlight (if we don’t turn up the heat on the stove), extra evaporation takes place solely due to the increase in temperature. Turning up the heat by increasing solar radiation, on the other hand, enhances the energy flow through the Earth’s surface because of the need to balance the greater energy input with stronger cooling fluxes from the surface. As a result, there is more evaporation and a stronger effect on the water cycle. When Kleidon and Maik Renner applied their results this particular geoengineering scenario, they found out that simultaneous changes in the water cycle and the atmosphere cannot be compensated for at the same time. Therefore, reflecting sunlight by geoengineering is unlikely to restore the planet’s original climate. ----- This report is published in the journal Earth System Dynamics.

The basis of this Dartmouth College study has to do with surface albedo (reflectivity). The report states that if you want to use the forest for climate control related purposes then it is better to have more open, snow covered meadows, which act like a mirror to incoming solar radiation compared to the darker, tree-covered forest. Key excerpt from Dartmouth, via EurekAlert..... Their results suggest that including the value of albedo can shorten optimal forest rotation periods significantly compared to scenarios where only timber and carbon are considered. For instance, in spruce and fir stands, very short rotation periods of 25 years become economically optimal when albedo is considered. The researchers attributed this to the low timber productivity and substantial snowfall in the White Mountain National Forest. Thus, they expect that in high latitude sites, where snowfall is common and forest productivity is low, valuing albedo may mean the optimal forest size is near zero.

As you can see from the video, the greatest amount of warming through 2100 is expected to be in the far northern latitudes as the surface absorbes more heat due to the loss of sea ice. In terms of precipitation, rainfall is expected to increase along the equatorial Pacific. Rainfall is also projected to increase in regions that are normally wet, while drier climatic regions will see reduced precipitation.

The research team, led by professor Ken Carslaw determined that the effect of aerosols, which have a cooling influence on the climate, greatly depends on what the atmosphere was like before the widespread impacts of man-made pollution. In order to better understand climate change, Carslaw says we need a better understanding of the very clean regions of the atmosphere, similar to what existed back in the mid-1700's. These regions are quite rare today, but they are out there and scientists are looking for them. One important factor is the influence of aerosols on cloud brightness. The team found that 45% of the variance comes from natural aerosols, such as those released from volcanic eruptions, compared to 34% for human-generated aerosols.

However, there are new efforts directed on the study of how the changing climate is impacting storms and so far there is a growing consensus that global warming may be producing stronger, but fewer storms, according to a new report from NASA's Earth Observatory. After Sandy devastated parts of the Northeast coast last year there were many questions about whether or not climate change had caused Sandy to be such an extreme event. Key excerpts from the NASA article......... Rising sea levels exacerbated Sandy’s storm surge, for example, a direct link between global warming and storm damage. And abnormally high sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic probably intensified the storm. But pinning all of Sandy’s fury—its hybrid nature, the scale of its winds, its unusual track—on global warming is premature , says Shepherd, the current president of the American Meteorological Society. Storms feed off of latent heat, which is why scientists think global warming is strengthening storms. Extra heat in the atmosphere or ocean nourishes storms; the more heat energy that goes in, the more vigorously a weather system can churn. A study based on over 20 years of satellite altimeter data showed that hurricanes intensify faster now than what they did 25 years ago, according to the report. Extra water vapor in the atmosphere is also making storms wetter. Over the past 25 years, satellites have detected a 4 percent rise in water vapor in the air column. Climatologists think the differing rates of warming from the equator to the poles could have a significant impact on some types of storms. Extra-tropical cyclones, for example, harvest energy from the atmosphere when masses of warm and cold air interact along the polar front—the boundary between cooler polar air and warmer subtropical air. As the difference between the temperature at the poles and the tropics decreases, there could be less energy for these storms to absorb, a change that could weaken them or make them less frequent. (via NASA) Latest research also suggests that Atlantic wind shear could increase by 1 to 2 mph for each degree that global temperatures increase, which is why many climate simulations project that the number of tropical cyclones will stay the same or decrease while the strongest storms get stronger. There has also been new research showing a possible link between Arctic sea ice extent and a slowing of the jet stream winds across the far north, which would lead to more high latitude blocking and the potential for colder, stormier weather farther to the south. Climate change should, theoretically, increase potential storm energy by warming the surface and putting more moisture in the air through evaporation, says Harold Brooks, a meteorologist at NOAA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory. But on the other hand, disproportionate warming in the Arctic should lead to less wind shear in the mid-latitude areas prone to severe thunderstorms, making the storms less likely. However, Another study, led by Robert Trapp of Purdue University, found that a doubling of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would significantly increase the number of days that severe thunderstorms could occur in the southern and eastern United States. Cities such as Atlanta and New York could see a doubling of the number of days that severe thunderstorms could occur, the models suggested. “The increase in CAPE more than compensated for the decrease in wind shear,” Trapp says. When it comes to the strength and number of tornadoes, there is just too much uncertainty at this point on whether or not climate change will have a significant impact.

The HadCRUT4 global temperature anomaly plot since 1850. Over recent decades, the HadCRUT4 dataset has covered about 84% of the globe, with unsampled regions over the poles \"Arctic/Antarctic hole\" and Africa, which according to the study can be a potential source of bias in global temperature reconstructions since the unsampled regions are not uniformly distributed over the Earth's surface. According to the RealClimate.org story, the \"Arctic hole\" is the main reason for the near-surface temperature differences that we see between the NASA GISS data set and the other two data sets, HadCrut and NOAA. The NASA GISS set fills in these polar gaps by interpolation from the edges, while the other two do not fill them in at all. If regions that are not covered (data gaps) warm up similar to the rest of the world then there is not much of an issue in regards to the accuracy of the data set. However, the Arctic has warmed much more than other parts of the world over the past 15 years, which presents a problem for the HadCRUT4. Two alternative methods for global temperature recontruction were explored and were validated on the basis of their skill at reconstructing omitted sets of observations. The two methods showed superior results compared to those that exclude the unsampled regions. The best of the previous alternative methods showed a two and a half time greater warming trend than the coverage-biased HadCRUT4 since 1997. The coverage-biased HadCRUT4 causes a cool bias in recent temperatures, which increases from around 1998 to present. For the 1997-2012 period the HadCRUT4 data set showed a slight warming trend of 0.05 C. per decade, but after filling in the gaps that trend becomes +0.10 C. after a applying a correction of ocean temperatures to the NASA data. The study abstract makes a key point that has been brought up on many occasions...... Trends starting in 1997 or 1998 are particularly biased with respect to the global trend. The issue is exacerbated by the strong El Niño event of 1997-1998, which also tends to suppress trends starting during those years. The RealClimate.org story finishes with this comment....... The public debate about the alleged “warming pause” was misguided from the outset, because far too much was read into a cherry-picked short-term trend. Now this debate has become completely baseless, because the trend of the last 15 or 16 years is nothing unusual – even despite the record El Niño year at the beginning of the period. It is still a quarter less than the warming trend since 1980, which is 0.16 °C per decade.

Then main reason for this increase in the steady uptick of climate-related disasters. Image below courtesy of EM-DAT International Disaster Database, Center for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters, University of Louvain. Since 1990, natural disasters have affected about 217 million people every year. Geophysical disasters include earthquakes, volcanoes, dry rockfalls, landslides and avalanches. Climate-related disasters include hydrological events such as floods, storm surge and coastal flooding, while meteorological events include storms, tropical cyclones, local storms, heat/cold waves, drought and wildfires. The number of geophysical disasters has remained fairly stable since the 1970's, while the number of climate-related (hydro-meteorological) disasters has greatly increased. As a result, the amount of economic damage due to these natural disasters has seen a steady upturn. There were three times as many natural disasters between 2000 to 2009 compared to the amount between 1980 and 1989. A vast majority (80%) of this growth is due to climate-related events. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the scale of disasters has expanded, owing to increased rates of urbanization, deforestation, environmental degradation and to intensifying climate variables such as higher temperatures, extreme precipitation and more violent wind/water storms. The report goes on to say..... natural disasters, particularly floods and storms, will become more frequent and severe because of climate change. Organized deadly onslaughts against civilian populations will continue, fueled by the availability of small arms, persistent social and political inequities, and, increasingly, by a struggle for natural resources. These events affect the mortality, morbidity, and well-being of large populations.

The study compared climate model predictions with actual global precipitation observations between 1979-2012. The research team found that natural variability (such as El Ninos and La Ninas) does not account for the changes in global precipitation patterns. While natural fluctuations in climate can lead to either intensification or poleward shifts in precipitation, it is very rare for the two effects to occur together naturally. Warming due to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is expected to make wet regions wetter and dry regions drier, according to the LLNL report. Storm tracks and subtropical dry zones will shift toward the poles due to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. \"In combination, man-made increases in greenhouse gases and stratospheric ozone depletion are expected to lead to both an intensification and redistribution of global precipitation,\" said Celine Bonfils, the other LLNL author. \"The fact that we see both of these effects simultaneously in the observations is strong evidence that humans are affecting global precipitation.\" Key statement from the conclusion of the study from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.... We have identified a fingerprint pattern that characterizes the simultaneous response of precipitation location and intensity to external forcing and acts as a noise filter. Observed changes in this multivariate response are incompatible with our best estimates of natural variability and consistent with model predictions of externally forced change. The synchronicity of these changes is key, however: considering either change in isolation does not lead to detection and attribution . By focusing on both the underlying mechanisms that drive changes in global precipitation, and by restricting our analysis to the large scales where we have some confidence in models’ ability to reproduce the current climate, we have shown that the changes observed in the satellite era are externally forced, and likely to be anthropogenic in nature. ---- Images courtesy of NOAA.

Geoengineering is the intentional, large-scale technological manipulation of the Earth’s systems. However, a new international study has found that geoengineering could cause the average global precipitation to decrease by 4.5 percent and reduce critical monsoonal rainfall in North America, East Asia and other regions by 5-7 percent compared to pre-industrial conditions. This new study from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) focused on efforts to shade the planet. The research team turned to 12 of the world’s leading climate models to simulate global precipitation patterns if the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide, a leading greenhouse gas, reached four times the level of the preindustrial era. They then simulated the effect of reduced incoming solar radiation on the global precipitation patterns, according to the NCAR/UCAR Atmospheric News. The team found that precipitation amounts and frequency, especially for heavy rain events, would decrease significantly. The effects were greater over land than over the ocean, and particularly pronounced during months of heavy, monsoonal rains. Monsoonal rains in the model simulations dropped by an average of 7 percent in North America, 6 percent in East Asia and South America, and 5 percent in South Africa. In India, however, the decrease was just 2 percent. Heavy precipitation further dropped in Western Europe and North America in summer. (via NCAR/UCAR) The two main reasons for this decrease in precipitation were the following..... 1. As Earth is shaded and less solar heat reaches the surface, less water vapor is pumped into the atmosphere through evaporation. 2. With more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, plants partially close their stomata, the openings that allow them to take in carbon dioxide while releasing oxygen and water into the atmosphere. Partially shut stomata release less water, so the cooled atmosphere would also become even drier over land. “Geoengineering the planet doesn’t cure the problem,” says NCAR scientist Simone Tilmes, lead author of the new study. “Even if one of these techniques could keep global temperatures approximately balanced, precipitation would not return to preindustrial conditions.” (via NCAR/UCAR) The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"6c1037b8dd290cd3a2a6c9dea36d519960eb41c3"}

How the Earth looked during the Late Cretaceous Period. Previous research had indicated that a continental ice sheet may have formed during that early period. However, a new study out of the University of Missouri has found evidence that no ice sheet had formed during the period. What is the importance of this new research? \"Currently, carbon dioxide levels are just above 400 parts per million (ppm), up approximately 120 ppm in the last 150 years and rising about 2 ppm each year,\" said Ken MacLeod, a professor of geological sciences at MU. \"In our study, we found that during the Late Cretaceous Period, when carbon dioxide levels were around 1,000 ppm, there were no continental ice sheets on earth.

At that level of CO2, will ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica be stable? If not, how will their melting affect the planet?\" Based on the 90 million year old data from Tanzania, Macleod indicated that those conditions are more in line with predictions that a doubling of CO2 levels would cause the Earth to warm an average of 6 degrees Celsius instead of 3 degrees Celsius. \"The Late Cretaceous climate was very warm, but the earth adjusted as changes occurred over millions of years. We're seeing the same size changes, but they are happening over a couple of hundred years, maybe 10,000 times faster. How that affects the equation is a big and difficult question,\" says Macleod.

The Working Group I contribution focused on the physical science of climate change. The Working Group I assessment comprises some 2,500 pages of text and draws on millions of observations and over 2 million gigabytes of numerical data from climate model simulations. Over 9,200 scientific publications are cited, more than three quarters of which have been published since the last IPCC assessment in 2007, according to the IPCC summary. Key points directly from the IPCC Working Group I Assessment ........ in regards to observed changes in the Earth's climate system. Atmosphere It is extremely likely (95-100% confidence) that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. Image courtesy of the IPCC. Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. In the Northern Hemisphere, 1983–2012 was likely (66-100%) the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years (medium confidence). In addition to robust multi-decadal warming, global mean surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and interannual variability. Due to natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends. Continental-scale surface temperature reconstructions show, with high confidence, multi-decadal periods during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (year 950 to 1250) that were in some regions as warm as in the late 20th century. These regional warm periods did not occur as coherently across regions as the warming in the late 20th century (high confidence). It is virtually certain (99-100% confidence) that globally the troposphere has warmed since the mid-20th century. Ocean Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010 (high confidence). It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0-700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely (66-100% confidence) warmed between the 1870s and 1971. More than 60% of the net energy increase in the climate system is stored in the upper ocean (0–700 m) during the relatively well-sampled 40-year period from 1971 to 2010, and about 30% is stored in the ocean below 700 m. Ice and Snow Over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass, glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide, and Arctic sea ice and Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover have continued to decrease in extent (high confidence) . Arctic summer sea ice retreat was unprecedented and sea surface temperatures were anomalously high in at least the last 1,450 years. It is very likely that the annual mean Antarctic sea ice extent increased at a rate in the range of 1.2 to 1.8% per decade between 1979 and 2012. There is very high confidence that the extent of Northern Hemisphere snow cover has decreased since the mid-20th century. Sea Level The rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia (high confidence). Over the period 1901–2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 meters. Carbon cycles The atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. CO2 concentrations have increased by 40% since pre-industrial times, primarily from fossil fuel emissions and secondarily from net land use change emissions. ----- I will cover additional key points from other sections of this 36-page report into next week.

Today we will highlight the latest projections directly from the IPCC report in regards to future climate change...... --Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. -- The global mean surface temperature change for the period 2016–2035 relative to 1986–2005 will likely be in the range of 0.3°C to 0.7°C (0.5 F to 1.25 F) (medium confidence). This assessment is based on multiple lines of evidence and assumes there will be no major volcanic eruptions or secular changes in total solar irradiance. CMIP5 multi-model simulated time series from 1950 to 2100 for change in global annual mean surface temperature relative to 1986–2005. FYI, The RCP2.6 scenario is based on aggressive emissions reduction, while the RCP8.5 is the \"business as usual\" scenario. --It is virtually certain that there will be more frequent hot and fewer cold temperature extremes over most land areas on daily and seasonal timescales as global mean temperatures increase. It is very likely that heat waves will occur with a higher frequency and duration. Occasional cold winter extremes will continue to occur. --Extreme precipitation events over most of the mid-latitude land masses and over wet tropical regions will very likely become more intense and more frequent by the end of this century. -- Globally, it is likely that the area encompassed by monsoon systems will increase over the 21st century. While monsoon winds are likely to weaken, monsoon precipitation is likely to intensify due to the increase in atmospheric moisture. Monsoon onset dates are likely to become earlier or not to change much. Monsoon retreat dates will likely be delayed, resulting in lengthening of the monsoon seas on in many regions. --The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century. Heat will penetrate from the surface to the deep ocean and affect ocean circulation. --Based on an assessment of the subset of models (see IPCC image below) that most closely reproduce the climatological mean state and 1979-2012 trend of the Arctic sea ice extent, a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September before mid-century is likely for RCP8.5 (medium confidence). A projection of when the Arctic might become nearly ice-free in September in the 21st century cannot be made with confidence for the other scenarios.

Radiative forcing (RF) is defined by the IPCC as the change in energy fluxes caused by changes in natural/man-made drivers for 2011 relative to 1750. The IPCC image below shows the RF by emissions and drivers. The total anthropogenic RF for 2011 relative to 1750 is 2.29 [1.13 to 3.33] W m/-2, and it has increased more rapidly since 1970 than during prior decades. The total anthropogenic RF best estimate for 2011 is 43% higher than that reported in the 4th Assessment Report (AR4) for the year 2005. This is caused by a combination of continued growth in most greenhouse gas concentrations and improved estimates of RF by aerosols indicating a weaker net cooling effect (negative RF). The total natural RF from solar irradiance changes and stratospheric volcanic aerosols made only a small contribution to the net radiative forcing throughout the last century, except for brief periods after large volcanic eruptions. Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes. This evidence for human influence has grown since AR4. It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period. Greenhouse gases contributed a global mean surface warming likely to be in the range of 0.5°C to 1.3°C over the period 1951−2010, with the contributions from other anthropogenic forcings, including the cooling effect of aerosols, likely to be in the range of −0.6°C to 0.1°C. The contribution from natural forcings is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C, and from internal variability is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C. Together these assessed contributions are consistent with the observed warming of approximately 0.6°C to 0.7°C over this period. Climate models The long-term climate model simulations show a trend in global-mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with the observed trend (very high confidence). There are, however, differences between simulated and observed trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years (e.g., 1998 to 2012). The observed reduction in surface warming trend over the period 1998–2012 as compared to the period 1951–2012, is due in roughly equal measure to a reduced trend in radiative forcing and a cooling contribution from internal variability, which includes a possible redistribution of heat within the ocean (medium confidence). The reduced trend in radiative forcing is primarily due to volcanic eruptions and the timing of the downward phase of the 11-year solar cycle. There has been substantial progress in the assessment of extreme weather and climate events since AR4. Simulated global-mean trends in the frequency of extreme warm and cold days and nights over the second half of the 20th century are generally consistent with observations. There is robust evidence that the downward trend in Arctic summer sea ice extent since 1979 is now reproduced by more models than at the time of the AR4, with about one-quarter of the models showing a trend as large as, or larger than, the trend in the observations. Most models simulate a small downward trend in Antarctic sea ice extent, albeit with large inter-model spread, in contrast to the small upward trend in observations. Dr. Chris Forest, associate professor of climate dynamics at the Pennsylvania State University and a lead author on chapter 9, the Evaluation of Climate Models, of the IPCC report told AccuWeather.com that a key factor in understanding the way climate models work is to not think of them as predictions but rather as projections. \"Given a possible future scenario of factors that are affecting climate change, we can run a climate model to produce the response of the climate system to those scenarios,\" he said. \"It's not going to be perfectly predicted, but we can see the path that we're on for the next multiple decades, so that's something that's quite straight forward.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"0070aa74d3a1b8d4f1b617165d02ea2322983e10"}

Antarctic Sea Ice extent is currently increasing at a rate of 1.1 percent per decade, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Why is Antarctic Sea Ice increasing? According to the NSIDC report, the increase is likely due to a combination of winds and ocean circulation.

The decrease in the global warming rate over the past 10-15 years, which was not well predicted by climate models may be more of a product of what Georgia Tech scientists call 'stadium waves'. Key excerpts from the Georgia Tech News Center story...... The paper’s authors, Marcia Wyatt and Judith Curry, point to the so-called ‘stadium-wave’ signal that propagates like the cheer at sporting events whereby sections of sports fans seated in a stadium stand and sit as a ‘wave’ propagates through the audience. In like manner, the ‘stadium wave’ climate signal propagates across the Northern Hemisphere through a network of ocean, ice, and atmospheric circulation regimes that self-organize into a collective tempo. Wyatt and Curry identified two key ingredients to the propagation and maintenance of this stadium wave signal: the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and sea ice extent in the Eurasian Arctic shelf seas. The AMO sets the signal’s tempo, while the sea ice bridges communication between ocean and atmosphere. The oscillatory nature of the signal can be thought of in terms of ‘braking,’ in which positive and negative feedbacks interact to support reversals of the circulation regimes. As a result, climate regimes — multiple-decade intervals of warming or cooling — evolve in a spatially and temporally ordered manner. While not strictly periodic in occurrence, their repetition is regular — the order of quasi-oscillatory events remains consistent. Wyatt’s thesis found that the stadium wave signal has existed for at least 300 years. The stadium wave periodically enhances or dampens the trend of long-term rising temperatures, which may explain the recent hiatus in rising global surface temperatures. The new hypothesis also indicates how long the reduction in the warming rate might last..... “The stadium wave signal predicts that the current pause in global warming could extend into the 2030s,\" said Marcia Wyatt, an independent scientist after having earned her Ph.D. from the University of Colorado in 2012. Sea ice impacts The study also provides an explanation for seemingly incongruous climate trends, such as how sea ice can continue to decline during this period of stalled warming, and when the sea ice decline might reverse. After temperatures peaked in the late 1990s, hemispheric surface temperatures began to decrease, while the high latitudes of the North Atlantic Ocean continued to warm and Arctic sea ice extent continued to decline. According to the ‘stadium wave’ hypothesis, these trends mark a transition period whereby the future decades will see the North Atlantic Ocean begin to cool and sea ice in the Eurasian Arctic region begin to rebound. ----- You can read much more about this hypothesis right here.

The team of scientists, lead by Professor Gifford Miller of the department of geological sciences used dead moss clumps from receding ice caps on Baffin Island as their tiny clocks. Radiocarbon dating showed that the mosses had not been exposed to the elements since at least 44,000 to 51,000 years ago. The results of this study offer the first, direct evidence that the present warmth in this region is greater than that from the early Holocene period (17,000 years ago) when the amount of the sun's energy reaching the Northern Hemisphere in the summer was 9% higher than today. Key excerpts from the University of Colorado Boulder report...... Since radiocarbon dating is only accurate to about 50,000 years and because Earth’s geological record shows it was in a glaciation stage prior to that time, the indications are that Canadian Arctic temperatures today have not been matched or exceeded for roughly 120,000 years, Miller said. “The key piece here is just how unprecedented the warming of Arctic Canada is,” said Miller, also a fellow at CU-Boulder’s Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research. “This study really says the warming we are seeing is outside any kind of known natural variability, and it has to be due to increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.” The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"ab183c3bac34da957caaa0a9d3625fbbf803f493"}

The team, which was led by Shayne McGregor of the Climate Research Center at the University of New South Wales developed a new way to look at past ENSO activity with a more consistent and robust point of view that helps answer many of the discrepancies from previous analyses.

How are these record maximums possible when there is overwhelming evidence which shows that the Southern Ocean is warming? To find out, a research team led by Jinlun Zhang, an oceanographer at the University of Washington's Applied Physics Laboratory performed a new computer modeling study that showed stronger polar winds produced an increase in Antarctic Sea ice, even in a warming climate. The results of the study showed that stronger westerly winds around the South Pole can explain 80 percent of the small increase in Antarctic Sea ice volume over the past 30 years. A previous study by Zhang showed that changes in water density could explain the remaining 20 percent of the increase. Why have the winds been getting stronger? Researchers are not quite sure, but it could be due to ozone depletion, global warming or natural cycles. Key excerpts from the University of Washington article..... The polar vortex that swirls around the South Pole is not just stronger than it was when satellite records began in the 1970s, it has more convergence, meaning it shoves the sea ice together to cause ridging. Stronger winds also drive ice faster, which leads to still more deformation and ridging. This creates thicker, longer-lasting ice, while exposing surrounding water and thin ice to the blistering cold winds that cause more ice growth. Differences between the two poles could explain why they are not behaving in the same way. Surface air warming in the Arctic appears to be greater and more uniform, Zhang said. Another difference is that northern water is in a fairly protected basin, while the Antarctic sea ice floats in open oceans where it expands freely in winter and melts almost completely in summer. The sea ice uptick in Antarctica is small compared with the amount being lost in the Arctic, meaning there is an overall decrease in sea ice worldwide.

Sudden climate shifts in the Pacific Ocean can have a major effect on the average global surface air temperature of the Earth, according to the GEOMAR report. The sudden warming of the tropical Pacific in the mid-1970s and the sudden cooling of the same region during the late 1990s caused notable changes in the Earth's climate. The late-1990s event likely played a significant role in slowing the global temperature increase over the past 10 to 15 years. Promising development for future climate prediction For the abrupt changes during the 1970s and 1990s, the researchers calculated predictions which began a few months prior to the beginning of the observed climate shifts. The average of all predictions for both abrupt changes shows good agreement with the observed climate development in the Pacific. \"The ocean plays a crucial role in our climate system, especially when it comes to fluctuations over several years or decades,\" explains Prof. Mojib Latif, co-author of the study. \"The chances of correctly predicting such variations are much better than the weather for the next few weeks, because the climate is far less chaotic than the rapidly changing weather conditions,\" said Latif. This is due to the slow changes in ocean currents which affect climate parameters such as air temperature and precipitation. \"The fluctuations of the currents bring order to the weather chaos\". ---- The above images and excerpts are courtesy of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research and C.

Arctic sea ice extent much higher than last year, but still below normal The main reason that the sea ice did not decline as much as some other recent years is that summer temperatures have been mostly below average in the central Arctic Ocean and into Greenland as sea level pressure has remained below normal. This pattern also led to less surface melting on the Greenland Ice Sheet. The NSIDC image below shows the low-level summer temperature anomalies in the arctic this past summer compared to two base periods (1981-2010, 2007-2012). Even though extent at the beginning of this summer was similar to last year, the melt season ended with considerably more ice. This is not surprising, as climate models consistently project that there will be large variations in summer ice extent from year to year. A cool summer can help to retain a thin layer of ice, increasing the overall ice extent. Conversely, a warm summer can help to remove much of the thin ice cover. The NOAA image below shows the summer 2013 sea level pressure anomalies. Note the well below-normal anomalies from the central Arctic to Greenland. Arctic sea ice volume, which is a better indicator of the health of sea ice, is running close to what it was back in 2010 and 2011, but higher than 2012. However, the longer term trend is clearly downhill. Image courtesy of the Polar Science Center from the University of Washington.

According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), current sea ice extent in the Antarctic is 3.9 percent above the average maximum extent for the 30-year period (1981-2010). However, keep in mind that this year's Arctic sea ice extent minimum is 30 percent below what was experienced back in the 1980's. Thus, the percentage loss in the Arctic is much greater than the gains in the Antarctic. Here is a nice explanation about Antarctic sea ice from NASA Earth Observatory.

Researchers from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado have found that heavy rainfall over Australia during 2010 and 2011, which was caused by three atmospheric patterns coming together over the Indian and Pacific Oceans, likely played a key role in temporarily halting the long-term global sea level rise caused by higher temperatures and melting ice sheets. The world's oceans have been rising by just more than 3 mm (0.1 inch) annually over recent decades, but during an 18-month period beginning in 2010 the global oceans saw a 7 mm (0.3 inch) drop. Image below courtesy of the University of Colorado Sea Level Research Group. Drought conditions have since returned to Australia as the atmospheric patterns have changed. Global sea levels are now rising faster than before according to the UCAR/NCAR News release. Australia is unique compared to other continents in that the soils and topography of the country prevent almost all of its precipitation from running off into the ocean. “The smallest continent in the world can affect sea level worldwide. Its influence is so strong that it can temporarily overcome the background trend of rising sea levels that we see with climate change,\" said NCAR scientist John Fasullo, the lead author of the study. “No other continent has this combination of atmospheric set-up and topography,” Fasullo says. “Only in Australia could the atmosphere carry such heavy tropical rains to such a large area, only to have those rains fail to make their way to the ocean.” The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"630106ca0706584acbe3dd8076dba21c3c652c74"}

The international research team used comprehensive computer simulations along with data from sediments at the bottom of the ocean and ancient raised shorelines across the world. According to the report, meltwater from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets will be the dominant contributors to sea level rise over the next two millennia. Global sea level rose on average 0.2 meters (7.8 inches) in the 20th century, according to the study. Key excerpts from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research press release..... “CO2, once emitted by burning fossil fuels, stays an awful long time in the atmosphere,” says Anders Levermann, lead author of the study and research domain co-chair at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “Consequently, the warming it causes also persists.” The oceans and ice sheets are slow in responding, simply because of their enormous mass, which is why observed sea-level rise is now measured in millimeters per year. “The problem is: once heated out of balance, they simply don’t stop,” says Levermann. “We’re confident that our estimate is robust because of the combination of physics and data that we use.” “Continuous sea-level rise is something we cannot avoid unless global temperatures go down again,” concludes Levermann. “Thus we can be absolutely certain that we need to adapt. Sea-level rise might be slow on time scales on which we elect governments, but it is inevitable and therefore highly relevant for almost everything we build along our coastlines, for many generations to come.” ---------- This study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The study showed that regions of high temperature variability shifted to areas of high population in Europe and North America over the past 50 years. \"The movement of raised temperature variability to regions of high population may have contributed to the general perception that climate is becoming more volatile,\" according to lead author Dr. Chris Huntingford from the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UK).

This accelerated rate of climate change will likely place a great deal of stress on terrestrial ecosystems around the world, according to the report, which is in the current issue of Science. Noah Diffenbaugh, an associate professor of environmental Earth system science, and Chris Field, a professor of biology and of environmental Earth system science and the director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution took a targeted but broad review of scientific literature on climate change that can affect ecosystems. They then looked at how recent observations and projections for the next century compare to past events in Earth's history, according to the report. Below are key excerpts from the Eurekalert story \"We know from past changes that ecosystems have responded to a few degrees of global temperature change over thousands of years,\" said Diffenbaugh. \"But the unprecedented trajectory that we're on now is forcing that change to occur over decades . That's orders of magnitude faster, and we're already seeing that some species are challenged by that rate of change.\" Extreme weather events such as heat waves and heavy rainfall are projected to become more severe and frequent..... For example, the researchers note that, with continued emissions of greenhouse gases at the high end of the scenarios, annual temperatures over North America, Europe and East Asia will increase 2-4 degrees C by 2046-2065. With that amount of warming, the hottest summer of the last 20 years is expected to occur every other year, or even more frequently. By the end of the century, should the current emissions of greenhouse gases remain unchecked, temperatures over the northern hemisphere will tip 5-6 degrees C warmer than today's averages. In this case, the hottest summer of the last 20 years becomes the new annual norm. Some climate changes will be unavoidable, because humans have already emitted greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and the atmosphere and oceans have already been heated. The more dramatic changes that could occur by the end of the century, however, are not written in stone. There are many human variables at play that could slow the pace and magnitude of change or accelerate it, according to Diffenbaugh.

The NOAA image below shows the global sea level anomaly (in inches) for 2012. Blue colors indicate above normal sea level, orange is below normal.

The NOAA chart below shows how the global average sea level has been in a fairly steady climb since 1993. In addition to thermal expansion from warmer climate patterns, part of the reason for the climb has been the increase in water being added to the oceans from melting glaciers and ice sheets.

A University of Arizona research team confirmed previous hypotheses which stated that mountain communities of the Southwest U.S. will be strongly impacted (vegetation changes) by the increasingly drier and warmer climate. This study was made possible by the existence of a plant dataset compiled in 1963 by Robert Whittaker on a tract of land along the Catalina Highway northeast of Tuscon, Arizona. The research team found that three quarters of the 27 catalogued plant species have shifted their range significantly higher and as much as 1,000 feet in some cases. Plants were also found to be growing in a narrower elevation range than what they were 50 years ago. Key excerpts from the University of Arizona News story... According to the authors, the main point emerging from the study is that plant communities on the mountain were different 50 years ago because plant species do not necessarily move toward higher elevations as a community. Rather, individual species shift their ranges independently, leading to a reshuffling of plant communities. Based on studies done by other scientists, including UA researchers, the researchers believe that a \"thirstier\" atmosphere might be a major driver behind the shifts in plant distribution, possibly even more so than lack of precipitation. As the atmosphere becomes warmer and drier, plants loose more water through their leave openings and become water-stressed.

The team also determined that ocean temperatures and the lack of Arctic sea ice cover were relatively unimportant factors in causing the extra Greenland melt, according to the University of Sheffield News. Hanna and his team used computer model simulation, weather station observations and satellite data to confirm this extreme event in which 90 percent of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface experienced some melting. The previous record was much lower at 52 percent back in 2010. Key excerpts from the University of Sheffield report...... “Our research found that a ‘heat dome’ of warm southerly winds over the ice sheet led to widespread surface melting. These jet stream changes over Greenland do not seem to be well captured in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) computer model predictions of climate change, and this may indicate a deficiency in these models. According to our current understanding, the unusual atmospheric circulation and consequent warm conditions of summer 2012 do not appear to be climatically representative of future ‘average’ summers predicted later this century. “Taken together, our present results strongly suggest that the main forcing of the extreme GrIS surface melt in July 2012 was atmospheric, linked with changes in the summer North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Greenland Blocking Index (GBI, a high pressure system centred over Greenland) and polar jet stream which favoured southerly warm air advection along the western coast.

Like greenhouse gases, volcanic aerosols perturb the Earth's radiation balance.

The research team, led by Dr. Hannes Baumann, mapped the differences in how the world's coastlines are experiencing climate change over the past 30 years. The researchers found that the coastal waters in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans have warmed three times higher than the global average. On the other hand, the South American Pacific coastal waters have been getting cooler over the last few decades. However, this cooling seems to be in line with global climate change predictions that forecast increases in coastal upwelling in this region of the world. Upwelling is a process that brings cold water from the deep ocean to the coast.

NASA GISS global temperature anomalies for the 2001-2010 decade. Some key points from the WMO press release. --The decade was the warmest on record for both the northern and southern Hemisphere and for both land and ocean surface temperatures. --94% of reporting countries to the WMO report had their warmest decade in 2001-2010 and no country reported a nationwide average decadal temperature anomaly cooler than the long term average. --Global mean sea levels rose about 3 millimeters per year during the decade, which is about double the observed 20th century trend of 1.6 millimeters per year. --Global sea level averaged over the 2001-2010 decade was about 20 cm (8 inches) higher than that of 1880. --The decadal rate of global temperature increase between 1991-2000 and 2001-2010 was unprecedented, according to WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud. --Every year of the decade except 2008 was among the 10 warmest years on record. --The highest temperature anomalies for the decade were across the high northern latitudes, with Greenland recording the largest decadal temperature anomaly of +1.71 degrees Celsius ( 3.08 F.). --The 2001-2010 decade was the most active decade since 1855 in terms of tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic Basin. --Unfortunately, more than 370,000 people perished during the decade as a result of extreme weather and climate conditions. A dramatic increase of heat wave related deaths from less than 6000 between 1991-2000 to 136,000 between 2001-2010 is the main reason for this large number. --Improved warning systems and preparedness actually led to a 16% decline in deaths due to storms and a 43% decline in deaths from floods. Key excerpt below from the WMO report....... “Natural climate variability, caused in part by interactions between our atmosphere and oceans – as evidenced by El Niño and La Niña events - means that some years are cooler than others. On an annual basis, the global temperature curve is not a smooth one. On a long-term basis the underlying trend is clearly in an upward direction, more so in recent times” said Mr Jarraud. Between 2001 and 2010, there was no major El Niño event, which normally leads to higher temperatures (as occurred in the then-record warm year of 1998). Much of the decade experienced either cooling La Niña or neutral conditions, except for the 2009/2010 moderate to strong El Niño. -------- Here is the link to the full report.

The research team looked at 14 climate model simulations that spanned 140-year periods that begin when CO2 concentrations were at pre-industrial levels (~280 ppm) followed by an increase of 1 percent per year. Model simulations spanning 140 years show that warming from carbon dioxide will change the frequency that regions around the planet receive no rain (brown), moderate rain (tan), and very heavy rain (blue). The occurrence of no rain and heavy rain will increase, while moderate rainfall will decrease. Animation courtesy of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio and YouTube. The team found that the wetter regions of the world, such as the equatorial Pacific and the Asian Monsoon regions will see increases in heavy precipitation, while regions with moderate and little rainfall could become drier. For every one degree F. of CO2-induced warming, heavy rainfall will increase globally by 3.9 percent and light rain will increase by 1.0 percent. Moderate rainfall will decrease by 1.4 percent, which means that there will be little change in total global rainfall. The models also projected that there will be a 2.6 percent global increase in the length of periods with no rainfall for every degree F. of warming. In the Northern Hemisphere, areas most likely to be affected include the deserts and arid regions of the southwest United States, Mexico, North Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan, and northwestern China. Key excerpt from the NASA story ....... Analyzing the model results, William Lau and his co-authors calculated statistics on the rainfall responses for a 27-year control period at the beginning of the simulation, and also for 27-year periods around the time of doubling and tripling of carbon dioxide concentrations. They conclude the model predictions of how much rain will fall at any one location as the climate warms are not very reliable. \"But if we look at the entire spectrum of rainfall types we see all the models agree in a very fundamental way -- projecting more heavy rain, less moderate rain events, and prolonged droughts,\" Lau said.

A recent study in the International Journal of Climatology analyzed the impact of the sea ice conditions of 2007 on the atmospheric circulation and temperatures. The year 2007 was used since it had the second lowest Arctic sea ice extent in the satellite era. Two 30-year simulations, one using the sea ice levels of 2007 and another using sea ice levels at the end of the 20th century, were used to access the impact of ice free seas. The results showed a significant response to the anomalous open water of 2007, according to the EurekAlert story. The results of the study confirmed that the increase in open water in the Arctic during 2007 led to an increase in temperature. The higher temperatures in the Arctic thus caused a decrease in the pole to equator temperature gradient which in turn created a weaker jet stream and less storminess in the mid-latitudes.

As many of you well know, the use of CFCs is also a known cause of ozone depletion over the pole. In-depth statistical data going back to 1850 shows that CFCs combined with cosmic rays caused both the polar ozone hole and global warming. Below are key excerpts from the University of Waterloo News release.... \"Most conventional theories expect that global temperatures will continue to increase as CO2 levels continue to rise, as they have done since 1850. What’s striking is that since 2002, global temperatures have actually declined – matching a decline in CFCs in the atmosphere,” Professor Lu said. “My calculations of CFC greenhouse effect show that there was global warming by about 0.6 °C from 1950 to 2002, but the earth has actually cooled since 2002. The cooling trend is set to continue for the next 50-70 years as the amount of CFCs in the atmosphere continues to decline.” In addition to the statistical analysis, the findings were also based on Professor Lu's cosmic-ray driven electron reaction (CRE) theory of ozone depletion, previous research into Antarctic ozone depletion and global surface temperatures. Data recorded from 1850 to 1970, before any significant CFC emissions, show that CO2 levels increased significantly as a result of the Industrial Revolution, but the global temperature, excluding the solar effect, kept nearly constant. The conventional warming model of CO2, suggests the temperatures should have risen by 0.6°C over the same period, similar to the period of 1970-2002.

Hansen wants to spend more time to focus on science and make it clearer to the public. Dr. Hansen along with Pushker Kharecha and Makiko Sato recently issued a commentary titled 'Doubling Down on our Faustian Bargain'. You can read it in its entirety right here. Why does the rate of global warming seem to be less this decade compared to what it was during the prior 25 years? The surge of fossil fuel emissions, especially from coal burning along with the increasing atmospheric CO2 level is fertilizing the biosphere and thereby limiting the growth of atmospheric CO2. It also appears that the aerosol cooling effect is probably increasing. Below are some of the more noteworthy excerpts made in the commentary in regards to CO2 growth and the impact of aerosols on the climate over the past decade. Aerosol cooling probably reduced global warming by about half over the past century, but the amount is uncertain because global aerosols and their effect on clouds are not measured accurately. Aerosol growth slowed in the 1970s with pollution controls in the U.S. and Europe, but accelerated again after 2000. The rapid growth of fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the past decade is mainly from increased coal use mostly in China with little control of aerosol emissions. It is thus likely that there has been an increase in the negative (cooling) climate forcing by aerosols in the past decade. An interesting point, however, is the failure of the observed increases in atmospheric CO2 to increase as rapidly as the fossil fuel source has increased. This fact is contrary to suggestions that terrestrial and ocean carbon sinks are tending to saturate as CO2 emissions continue. Image courtesy of NASA GISS. An informative presentation of CO2 observations is the ratio of annual CO2 increase in the air divided by annual fossil fuel CO2 emissions, the \"airborne fraction\" (image above). This airborne fraction, clearly, is not increasing. Thus the net ocean plus terrestrial sink for carbon emissions has increased by a factor of 3 to 4 since 1958, accommodating the emissions increase by that factor. We suggest that the surge of fossil fuel use, mainly coal, since 2000 is a basic cause of the large increase of carbon uptake by the combined terrestrial and ocean carbon sinks. Reduction of the net human-made climate forcing by aerosols has been described as a \"Faustian bargain,\" because the aerosols constitute deleterious particulate air pollution. Reduction of the net climate forcing by half will continue only if we allow air pollution to build up to greater and greater amounts. More likely, humanity will demand and achieve a reduction of particulate air pollution, whereupon, because the CO2 from fossil fuel burning remains in the surface climate system for millennia, the \"devil's payment\" will be extracted from humanity via increased global warming.

The goal of the study was to compare the summer climate in the United States during the the 2072-2099 period with the past period of 1962-1989. The research team, led by Robert Trapp, focused on global warming's potential impact on summer wind shear and convective available potential energy, which is otherwise known as CAPE. CAPE is a measure of how much raw energy is available for storms; it relates to how warm, moist, and buoyant air is in a given area. Wind shear is a measure of how the speed and direction of winds change with altitude, according to the NASA report. Scientists have evidence that global warming should increase CAPE by warming the surface and putting more moisture in the air through evaporation. On the other hand, disproportionate warming in the Arctic should lead to less wind shear in mid-latitude areas prone to severe thunderstorms. So one factor makes severe storms more likely, while the other makes them less so. (from the NASA report) Predicted change in severe thunderstorm environment days from the 1962-1989 period to the 2072-2099 period. This particular modeling study found that the eastern U.S. will see an increase in severe thunderstorm environment days during the summer, while the West will see little change or a slight decrease. The greatest increase in days is expected to occur along the Southeast U.S. coast and in a region around Missouri.

Previous work by Eric Steig, a University of Washington professor of Earth and space sciences showed that rapid thinning of Antarctic glaciers was accompanied by rapid warming and changes in atmospheric circulation near the coast. His research with Qinghua Ding, a UW research associate, showed that the majority of Antarctic warming came during the 1990s in response to El Niño conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean. (from the University of Washington News) This new study now indicates that the 1990's were not greatly different from other warm decades such as the 1830's, 1940's and others. Key excerpts from the University of Washington News report.... “If we could look back at this region of Antarctica in the 1940s and 1830s, we would find that the regional climate would look a lot like it does today, and I think we also would find the glaciers retreating much as they are today,” said Steig, lead author of a paper on the findings published online April 14 in Nature Geoscience. The most prominent of these in the last 200 years – the 1940s and the 1830s – were also periods of unusual El Niño activity like the 1990s. The implication, Steig said, is that rapid ice loss from Antarctica observed in the last few decades, particularly the ’90s, “may not be all that unusual.” The same is not true for the Antarctic Peninsula, the part of the continent closer to South America, where rapid ice loss has been even more dramatic and where the changes are almost certainly a result of human-caused warming, Steig said.

The scientific team evaluated the temperature change on the Earth's continents over the past 1,000 to 2,000 years using tree rings data, tree pollen, corals, ice cores and lake sediments. This particular long-term cooling trend was caused by factors such as fluctuations in the amount and distribution of heat from the sun and increases in volcanic activity, according to the National Science Foundation report. The researchers also found that the 20th century ranked as the warmest or nearly warmest century on almost all of the continents. The exception was Antarctica. There was insufficient data to rank Africa. Key excerpts from the NSF report... Because long-range cooling was caused by natural factors that continued to exist in the 20th century, the authors argue, the warming of the 20th century makes it more difficult to discount the effects of the increase of greenhouse gases in the global increase of temperatures measured in recent decades. \"The new results show that climate change is, as usual, more complicated than we expected: long, millennial natural cooling trends were punctuated by warming episodes that turned out to be more local than we thought,\" said Paul E. Filmer, program director for the Paleoclimate, Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology and ArcSEES programs in NSF's Geosciences Directorate. \"The natural forces driving the cooling are still present today, but since the nineteenth century an additional, stronger, warming driver has been added: human activity.

Researchers found that plants release a higher amount of certain gases as temperatures warm. As this gas oxidizes in the atmosphere it sticks to aerosol particles, growing them into the larger-sized particles that reflect sunlight and also serve as the basis for cloud droplets. Just like aerosols from man-made emissions and volcanic eruptions, these biogenic aerosols have a cooling effect on the atmosphere. The scientists collected data at 11 different sites around the world, measuring the concentrations of aerosol particles in the atmosphere, along with the concentrations of plant gases, the temperature, and estimates for the height of the boundary layer. “Everyone knows the scent of the forest,” says Ari Asmi, University of Helsinki researcher who also worked on the study. “That scent is made up of these gases.” While previous research had predicted the feedback effect, until now nobody had been able to prove its existence except for case studies limited to single sites and short time periods, according to a report from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. The effect of this increase in plant emissions only reduces warming by 1 percent on global scale. However, the study showed that the effect was much larger on a regional scale, counteracting possibly up to 30% of warming in more rural, forested areas where anthropogenic emissions of aerosols were much lower in comparison to the natural aerosols, according to the report.

Earlier studies put the blame on the increasing amounts of pollutants being released from countries like China and India. Instead, the researchers found that sulfur dioxide emissions from a large number of small to moderate size volcanoes across the world had a role in slowing the rate of warming last decade. Key excerpts from the University of Colorado Boulder report..... Ryan Neely, the lead author of the study, said previous observations suggest that increases in stratospheric aerosols since 2000 have counterbalanced as much as 25 percent of the warming scientists blame on human greenhouse gas emissions. “This new study indicates it is emissions from small to moderate volcanoes that have been slowing the warming of the planet,” said Neely, a researcher at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, a joint venture of CU-Boulder and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The new study relies on long-term measurements of changes in the stratospheric aerosol layer’s \"optical depth,\" which is a measure of transparency, said Neely. Since 2000, the optical depth in the stratospheric aerosol layer has increased by about 4 to 7 percent, meaning it is slightly more opaque now than in previous years. \"...overall these eruptions are not going to counter the greenhouse effect.

The study, which was based on independent climate forecasts for the period from 2040 to 2059, shows that even ordinary shipping vessels will be able to navigate previously inaccessible parts of the Arctic Ocean, and they will not need icebreakers to blaze their path as they do today. This obviously would be great news in terms of economic development, but bring an additional element of danger. The Arctic ice sheet is also expected to thin to the point that polar icebreakers will in the future be able to navigate right across the North Pole between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The route directly over the North Pole is 20 percent shorter than the Northern Sea Route, which is today's most-trafficked Arctic shipping lane. The Northern Sea Route is also 40% shorter that the popular route through the Suez Canal.

The researchers factored in two scenarios for climate change: one that assumed a 25 percent increase in global carbon emissions, which is generally expected to produce a medium-low increase in temperatures, and one that assumed an additional 10 percent increase in emissions, which is expected to produce a higher increase in temperatures.

The ESA satellite indicates that the Arctic has lost more than a third of its summer sea-ice volume since a decade ago when a U.S. satellite also made actual observations.

Well, it depends on the time of the year. My friends from the Rutgers University Global Snow Lab (my alma mata 89') keep a close track of global snow cover and have data that go back to the 1960's. For the month of January, there has actually been an upward trend in snow cover over the past dozen years. Part of the reason for this is that the significant warming in the high latitudes over the past 20 years has caused an increase in moisture (warmer air holds more moisture than cold) and thus more snowfall over areas that are normally quite dry during the winter. However, it is a different story when you look at the month of June below.... There has been a fairly sharp decrease in snow cover anomalies across the northern hemisphere for June. Obviously, snow cover is normally confined to the far north and very high elevations during this time of year, but this also makes sense with the amount of warming and the reduction of sea ice that we have seen in this part of the globe over that past 20-30 years. Temperatures in June are just getting too warm to support snow cover in some areas that were normally still covered with snow over the past 40 years. When we look at all the months going back to 1966 we can see that snow cover has been averaging below normal since the mid-1980's, but that the trend since the mid-1980's has been quite stable. The longer term trend since 1966 appears to be slightly downward though. ------ All images courtesy of the Rutgers University Global Snow Lab The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"863aaa3408bbcfe9824afc413fbc02d56a1287a1"}

Scientists from 14 countries contributed to this research as part of the North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (NEEM) project. The Eemian Interglacial period occurred 130,000 to 115,000 years ago. The team found that the Eemian period was warmer than previously thought, peaking at the NEEM site at roughly 8 degrees Celsius above the mean of the past millennium. At the time, the Earth was closer to the sun in the summer, allowing more solar energy to reach the surface. (via Scientific American) The research team found that the thickness of the Northwest Greenland Ice Sheet in the Eemian Period declined about 25 percent, or roughly 400 meters, over a 6,000-year period. This reduction in elevation was considered moderate. Excerpt from the Scientific American story...... The \"moderate\" reaction of Greenland meant that its melting ice sheet contributed less than half -- or 2 meters or less -- to rising sea levels in the Eemian period, according to Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, and leader of the NEEM project. At the time, seas were likely 4 to 8 meters higher than now, according to Dahl-Jensen. Since the world's glaciers combined with thermal expansion would have only contributed a fraction of the 4 to 8 meter rise it is likely that the larger portion of the rise would have come from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Some scientists are not yet convinced by these results and question some of the findings within the study. One thing that is fairly clear is that for the immediate future the Greenland Ice Sheet will still be the biggest contributor to sea level rise as Greenland has experienced more dramatic melting than Antarctica since the 1990's as temperatures have warmed more quickly in the far north.

Below, Hansen makes some valid points about 2012 and temperature trends....... The top 10 warmest years on record all occurred since 1998. The 5-year mean global temperature has been flat for a decade, which they interprete asa combination of natural variability and a slowdown in the growth rate of the net climate forcing. Short-term global fluctuations are associated principally with natural oscillations of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (El Nino/La Nina) The long-term warming trend, including continual warming since the mid-1970's, has been conclusively associated with the predominant global climate forcing, human-made greenhouse gases , which grew steadily in the early 20th century. The period of cooling that took place between 1940 and 1975 was likely attributed to a balance of aerosol cooling from low air pollution standards and greenhouse gas warming. A slower growth rate of the net climate forcing may have contributed to the standstill of global temperature in the past decade, but it cannot explain the standstill, because it is known that the planet has been out of energy balance, more energy coming in from the sun than energy being radiated to space. The planetary energy imbalance is due largely to the increase of climate forcings in prior decades and the great thermal inertia of the ocean. The more important factor in the standstill is probably unforced dynamical variability, essentially climatic \"noise\". If solar irradiance were the dominant drive of climate change that most global warming contrarians believe, then a global cooling trend might be expected. ......the continuing planetary energy imbalance and the rapid increase of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use assure that global warming will continue on decadal time scales. Our interpretation of the larger role of unforced variability in temperature change of the past decade, suggests that global temperature will rise significantly in the next few years as the tropics moves inevitably into the next El Nino phase. The one major wild card in projections of future climate change is the unmeasured climate forcing due to aerosol changes and their effects on clouds.

It demonstrates the value and potential of this approach for a wide range of similar problems in climate change research, where past data and current numerical modelling have significant limitations when it comes to forecasting future trends and patterns.\" (via University of Bristol) The research team of Bamber and Professor Willy Aspinall determined that the median estimate for sea level rise due to ice sheet melting alone was 29 cm (~about a foot) by 2100. When they combined the above result with other sources of sea level rise they found a conceivable risk of a rise of greater than one meter (100 cm) by 2100. On the other hand, the most recent IPCC range estimate for sea level rise by 2100 was anywhere from 18 cm to 59 cm for six possible scenarios. Of note, the University of Bristol press release reports that the researchers also found that the scientists, as a group, were highly uncertain about the cause of the recent increase in ice sheet mass loss observed by satellites and equally unsure whether this was part of a long term trend or due to short-term fluctuations in the climate system. ----- NBC News Science just posted about this same study and quoted the author as saying that the consequences are horrible .

Data from the Rutgers University Snow Lab goes back to 1967. Studies of snow cover published in Geophysical Research Letters and the Arctic Report Card: Update for 2012 found that, between 1979 and 2012, June snow cover extent decreased by 17.6 percent per decade compared to the 1979–2000 average.

A four-year assessment by an international panel has determined that black carbon (soot) is the number two contributor. The soot particles of smoke and smog, otherwise known as black carbon was found to contribute about two times more to global warming than previous estimates. Black carbon cloud droplets. Excerpt from the University of Washington news .......... Black carbon’s role in climate is complex. Dark particles in the air work to shade the Earth’s surface while warming the atmosphere. Black carbon that settles on the surface of snow and ice darkens the surface to absorb more sunlight and increase melting. Finally, soot particles influence cloud formation in ways that can have either a cooling or warming impact. Black carbon deposits on the Himalayan Range. The good news is that black carbon only stays in the atmosphere for only a few days, so that reducing these emissions can yield much more immediate results compared to atmospheric CO2, which has a half-life of 100 years. The researchers found that reducing emissions from diesel engines followed by replacing some wood and coal burning household stoves would have the greatest immediate cooling impact when it comes to black carbon.

The 'debate', however, is becoming a thing of the past in the scientific community, Mann explained in segment three of the interview. \"The warming of the planet, that's established...\" he said. But Mann does not argue whether there is disbelief among non-scientists. \"I think there's some contrarians who will probably never be convinced. There are still geologists that don't accept plate tectonics. Generationally, now there's very few but there are still a few around that question plate tectonics.

With the scientific community in acceptance of climate change, funding is being spent less and less on proving the occurrence, but rather on determining what effect climate change will have on features such as El Nino. Despite the amount of research being done, Mann admits that some uncertainty remains in what effects the warming planet will have. \"It's possible that the impacts could be less than the models are predicting but its also possible that they'll be worse,\" he said. \"And some of the data that are coming in, whether it's the melting of the ice sheets, the melting of Arctic sea ice, the increased drought conditions in large parts of the northern hemisphere, the evidence that's coming in is starting to suggest that uncertainty may be breaking against us, the impacts may be coming faster and they may be worse than the models are predicting.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"a90928582cb77de5a88d14d65257ad60c2501b32"}

Areas of ice loss and gain over Antarctica since 1992. Using combined observations from ten different satellite missions the research team was able to produce the first consistent measurement of polar ice sheet changes over Greenland and Antarctica. The results of the study indicate that the combined melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets has added 11.1 mm or 1.1 cm to global sea levels over the past 20 years. Of note, two-thirds of the ice loss was from Greenland and the rest from Antarctica, according to the ESA story. Combined, Greenland and Antarctica are losing more than three times as much ice as they were in the 1990's. Key excerpts from the ESA report.... The new estimates are a vast improvement – more than twice as accurate – thanks to the inclusion of more satellite data, and confirm that both Antarctica and Greenland are losing ice. Earth observation satellites are key to monitoring the polar ice because they carry instruments that measure changes in the thickness of the ice sheets, fluctuations in the speed of the outlet glaciers and even small changes in Earth’s gravity field caused by melting ice. “The rate of ice loss from Greenland has increased almost five-fold since the mid-1990s. “In contrast, while the regional changes in Antarctic ice over time are sometimes quite striking, the overall balance has remained fairly constant – at least within the certainty of the satellite measurements we have to hand,” said co-leader of the study Dr Erik Ivins from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Winters are also projected to be wetter, with more rain than snow. This climate study, which was run by University of Massachusetts scientists is posted in the current issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research. The study provides the highest resolution climate projections to date for the Northeast from Pennsylvania to Maine for the period from 2041 to 2070, according to Michael Rawlins and Raymond Bradley of the Climate System Research Center at UMass Amherst, with Henry Diaz of NOAA's Climate Diagnostics Center, Boulder, Colo. Some key findings from the report...... 1. The Northeast region is projected to warm by some 2-3 degrees C. (3.5-5.5 F) by mid-century, with localized warming approaching 3.5 C. (6.3 F) during winter. Putting this into better perspective by calculating a 4-5 degree F. increase in average temperature I estimate that winter temperatures in Boston by mid-century will feel more like what Philadelphia is today if this study ends up on target. The same goes for Philadelphia during mid-century having winter temperatures similar to what Richmond, VA has today. 2. Precipitation will likely go up, especially in the winter, but not uniformly. Excerpts from the EurekAlert report..... \"The only clear signal of change for precipitation is noted in winter, which appears to be heading toward wetter conditions, consistent with current trends,\" Rawlins says. Winter precipitation is projected to rise significantly above natural weather variability, around 12 to 15 percent greater from southwest Pennsylvania to northern Maine, with the exception of coastal areas, where projected increases are lower. \"But we shouldn't expect more total seasonal snowfall,\" he adds. \"Combined with the model-projected temperature trends, much of the increase will occur as rain. We're losing the snow season. It is contracting, with more rain in early and late winter.\" The study assumes that greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise going from nearly 400 ppm today to between 500-600 ppm in 2070. Bradley and Rawlins acknowledge that this outlook represents the \"most aggressive, most troubling higher emissions trajectory scenario\" for CO2 levels, but they point out that so far there is little evidence that society will act to appreciably change the current rate of increase, according to EurekAlert.

Heat waves will become more severe in most regions of the Northeast and Southeast U.S. with a sharp increase in precipitation, which would obviously lead to more widespread, severe flooding events. Harnessing supercomputing power of UT’s Kraken and Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s (ORNL) Jaguar (now Titan, the fastest in the world), the researchers combined high-resolution topography, land use information and climate modeling. Then, they used dynamical downscaling to develop their climate model results. Dynamical downscaling allowed the researchers to develop climate scales as small as four square kilometers, according to the University of Tennessee's Tennessee Today. The researchers analyzed the present-day climate from 2001-04 and projected the future climate from 2057-59. In comparing present climate to future, the researchers found that heat waves will become more severe throughout the eastern part of the nation. The results also showed that there will be a greater increase in heat waves in the Northeast and eastern Midwest compared to the Southeast, which could almost equalize the temperatures between the future Northeast/Midwest and the current South. The Northeast and eastern Midwest will experience a greater increase in heat waves than the Southeast, which will almost equalize the temperatures between the future North and current South. Also, both the Northeast and Southeast will experience an increase of precipitation of 35 percent or more.

The troposphere is the lowest portion of earth's atmosphere. The stratosphere is right above the troposphere, generally between 6 and 30 miles above earth's surface. Key excerpts from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory news release..... In both satellite observations and the computer model simulations of historical climate change, the lower stratosphere cools markedly over the past 33 years. This cooling is primarily a response to the human-caused depletion of stratospheric ozone. The observations and model simulations also show a common pattern of large-scale warming of the lower troposphere, with largest warming over the Arctic, and muted warming (or even cooling) over Antarctica. Tropospheric warming is mainly driven by human-caused increases in well-mixed greenhouse gases. Temperature trend of the lower stratosphere since 1979. Courtesy Remote Sensing Systems.

Columbia Glacier. Image courtesy of the NSIDC. The Columbia Glacier is a large (425 square miles), multi-branched glacier in south-central Alaska that flows mostly south out of the Chugach Mountains to its tidewater terminus in Prince William Sound, according to the University of Colorado at Boulder story. The Columbia Glacier was first documented in 1794 when it appeared to be stable with a length of 41 miles. During the 1980s it began a rapid retreat and by 1995 it was only about 36 miles long. By late 2000 it was about 34 miles long. (from the University of Colorado) The results of this study were a surprise to scientists. What they found was that a single glacier's contribution to sea level rise can \"turn on\" and \"turn off\" quite rapidly, over a couple of years, with the precise timing of the life cycle being difficult to forecast. The research team determined that around 2020 the terminus of the Columbia Glacier will retreat into water that is sufficiently shallow to provide a stable position (no significant retreat or advance) through 2100 by slowing the rate of iceberg production. The future for the Columbia Glacier, however, looks bleak. \"I think the hope was that once we saw climate change happening, we could act to prevent some irreversible consequences,\" said William Colgan of the CU-Boulder headquartered Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, \"but now we are only about eight years out from this retreat finishing -- it is really sad. There is virtually no chance of the Columbia Glacier recovering its pre-retreat dimensions on human time-scales.\" (via University of Colorado Boulder) This study is published in The Cryosphere, an open access publication of the European Geophysical Union. -------- United Nations Climate Conference The United Nations Climate Conference began Monday in Doha, Qatar and will continue through December 7th.

The sun's output has not shown a net increase over the past 30 years, so it cannot be responsible for the most recent warming trend. Going back farther, scientists looked at sunspots and determined that there was a slight increase in solar energy during the first half of the 20th century and a slight decrease during the second half, according to the National Research Council and the National Academy of Science. Another way to answer the question is to look at the different layers of the Earth's atmosphere. Actual data show a warming trend in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) and a cooling trend in the higher atmosphere (stratosphere), which is exactly what is expected from greenhouse warming. If the sun was responsible there would be a more uniform warming through both of those layers of the atmosphere, according to the video.

One surprising feedback is Arctic sea ice. Melting sea ice in itself does not raise the sea-level, similar to ice in a drink. However, the reduction of sea ice in the Arctic is playing a key role in the warming of the Arctic, which in turn leads to ice losses in nearby Greenland and over the land areas of northern Canada. Also, when the sea ice melts it reduces the amount of fresh water in the Arctic as more brinier, warmer water mixes in from the south. This process is not in any of the models, according to Hay. The record low sea ice extent in the Arctic this year. Then there are those gigantic stores of ice in Greenland and Antarctica. During the last interglacial period, sea level rose 10 meters due to the melting of all that ice -- without any help from humans. New data suggests that the sea-level rise in the oceans took place over a few centuries, not thousands of years, according to Hay. (via The Geological Society of America) Greenland had a record-setting melt this past summer. Another positive feedback is the amount of groundwater being mined across the world in order to ease drought. That water eventually gets added to the oceans as shown by a recent visualization by NASA's Earth Observatory. In closing from The Geological Society of America article..... \"You would expect negative feedbacks to creep in at some point,\" says Hay. \"But in climate change, every feedback seems to go positive.\" The reason is that Earth's climate seems to have certain stable states. Between those states things are unstable and can change quickly. \"Under human prodding, the system wants to go into a new climate state.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"4c1454201304296f9c659ba5c32016b6aa5bb7b1"}

Why is that? A research team led by NCAR scientists John Fasullo and Kevin Trenberth showed that the climate models that most accurately captured complex moisture (relative humidity) processes and associated clouds in the tropics and subtropics were the ones that showed the greatest amount of warming as greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise globally, according to UCAR.

That evidence was gathered by maps created by the JPL, which used over 5 million individual daily ice motion measurements taken over a 19-year period by US Defense Meteorological satellites, according to the BAS press release . Excerpt from the BAS press release...... Until now, these changes in Antarctic ice drift were only speculated upon, using computer models of Antarctic winds, according to lead author Dr. Paul Holland of the BAS. The total Antarctic sea-ice cover is increasing slowly, but individual regions are actually experiencing much larger gains and losses that are almost offsetting each other overall. We now know that these regional changes are caused by changes in the winds, which in turn affect the ice cover through changes in both ice drift and air temperature. The changes in ice drift also suggest large changes in the ocean surrounding Antarctica, which is very sensitive to the cold and salty water produced by sea-ice growth, said Holland. Dr. Ron Kwok of the JPL notes that it is important to distinguish between the Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is losing volume and Antarctic sea ice, which is expanding. ----- Again, you can read the full press release right here.

The problem has to do with the way of calculating a quantity called potential evaporation, the amount of evaporation that would occur given an unlimited water supply. Historically, scientists calculated potential evaporation using the Thornthwaite equation, which is based entirely on temperature. The more complete Penman-Monteith equation, by contrast, incorporates the influences of solar radiation, humidity and wind speed. The latter gives a much more accurate measure of potential evaporation, says study coauthor Justin Sheffield, a hydroclimatologist at Princeton University. (via ScienceNews) The research team proceeded to calculate global drought trends from 1950 to 2008 using both equations on multiple datasets. Notably, they found a much smaller change in drought using the Penman-Monteith equation. The estimated yearly drought increase was only half as severe as that derived from the Thornthwaite equation. Another unrelated recent study by Aiguo Dai, an atmospheric scientist at the State University of New York at Albany puts into question this particular conclusion by Sheffield and his team, indicating that the study fails to consider trends in soil moisture and other variables. He also claims that the new study relies on outdated weather records and questionable radiation data. However, Sheffield and colleagues attribute the disagreement to inconsistencies in the weather data used by Dai and others.

Researchers examined the wind patterns in the subarctic in the early summer between 2007 and 2012 as compared to the average for 1981 to 2010. They discovered that the previously normal west-to-east flowing upper-level winds have been replaced by a more north-south undulating, or wave-like pattern, according to the NOAA news report. This new wind pattern transports warmer air into the Arctic and pushes Arctic air farther south toward the mid-latitudes, potentially leading to more persistent weather patterns. Negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation (higher pressures over the Arctic), which forces cold air farther south into the mid-latitudes Enhanced warming of the Arctic affects the jet stream by slowing its west-to-east winds and by promoting larger north-south meanders in the flow, according to NOAA. However, predicting those meanders and where the weather associated with them will be located in any given year, however, remains a challenge, according to NOAA. For example, the previous two winters were very different from one another in North America. There was strong high pressure blocking in the northern latitudes both winters, but the position of these high pressure ridges was very different. Knowing where these blocking highs set up during long periods of the winter is crucial to the forecasts. The researchers say that with more solar energy going into the Arctic Ocean because of lost ice, there is reason to expect more extreme weather events, such as heavy snowfall, heat waves, and flooding in North America and Europe but these will vary in location, intensity, and timescales.

Weather can play a game-changing role in voter turn out at the polls. \"So when we're thinking about voter turn out, what we're considering is what kinds of costs are imposed on people, in terms of showing up at the polls,\" Berkman said. \"Some people are much more responsive to higher costs of different types, whether they be information costs, getting to the polls, traveling a distance, there are a variety of ways of thinking about it. Weather imposes a cost.\" In rural areas, the cost may be having to drive a long distance in poor weather, and in an urban area, you may have to stand out in the rain. \"To some people, to a really committed voter, what we call a core voter, none of this will make a difference. They'll get to the polls no matter what it takes,\" Berkman said. \"But to a peripheral voter, somebody who is not as committed in any given election, weather can be one of many things that, kind of, shapes their decision to stay home and put it off. 'I'm going to wait an hour, wait an hour,' and next thing you know the polls are closed.\" Research is consistent in that Republicans are most likely to endure the \"cost\" of weather. In a perfect storm scenario, this could tip the balance at the polls and determine an election. Data has confirmed this could have been the case in two historic elections. \"The best analysis I've seen of this was done on 14 elections, so over a number of years, and we're looking at turn out in various counties.\" Data showed that an inch of rain above normal could bring voter turn out down by as much as one percent. One inch of above-normal snowfall could bring turnout down by half of a percentage point. \"There have been simulations that have been run that estimate, for example the 1960 election with John Kennedy. With some more rain in Illinois, it could have made a difference. Nixon could have won. Because the way the electoral college works, you only need rain in a very isolated area.\" A more recent example is the 2000 election in Florida. \"Perhaps if it hadn't rained in the panhandle that day, Democratic turn out could have been higher. They could have picked up the 600 votes to win.\" If there's any extreme weather in any of the swing states this election, it's going to hurt the Democrats more than any one else, he said.

The research team evaluated 7 computer simulation models used to compile the reports that the IPCC issues every six years. The researchers fed historical climate records into the models and compared their results to the actual climate change observed between then and now, according to the story. The team evaluated climate predictions from 1900 into the future, such as 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 years. Then the same starting in 1901, 1902 and so forth, and applied statistics to the results. The goal of the study was to bridge the communities of climate scientists and weather forecasters, who sometimes disagree with respect to climate change, according to Xubin Zeng, a professor in the University of Arizona department of atmospheric sciences. Excerpts from the University of Arizona News story...... “Climate scientists are correct because we do show that on the continental scale, and for time scales of three decades or more, climate models indeed show predictive skills. But when it comes to predicting the climate for a certain area over the next 10 or 20 years, our models can’t do it,\" said Zeng, who serves on the Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate of the National Academies and the Executive Committee of the American Meteorological Society. The skill of a climate model depends on three criteria at a minimum, Zeng explained. The model has to use reliable data, its prediction must be better than a prediction based on chance, and its prediction must be closer to reality than a prediction that only considers the internal climate variability of the Earth system and ignores processes such as variations in solar activity, volcanic eruptions, greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and land-use change, for example urbanization and deforestation. “Our analysis confirmed what we expected from last IPCC report in 2007,” said Koichi Sakaguchi. “Those climate models are believed to be of good skill on large scales, for example predicting temperature trends over several decades, and we confirmed that by showing that the models work well for time spans longer than 30 years and across geographical scales spanning 30 degrees or more.\" ------- This research was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres.

The Northeast Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) extends from the Gulf of Maine to Cape Hatteras, N.C. The average sea surface temperature (SST) exceeded 51.0 degrees F during the first half of 2012, breaking the previous record high set in 1951. For the past three decades, the average SST has been 48 degrees F. In some nearshore locations such as the Delaware and Chesapeake bays in the Middle Atlantic Bight region, temperatures were more than 11 degrees F above historical average at the surface and more than 9 degrees F above average at the bottom. \"A pronounced warming event occurred on the Northeast Shelf this spring, and this will have a profound impact throughout the ecosystem,\" said Kevin Friedland, a scientist in the NEFSC's Ecosystem Assessment Program. \"Changes in ocean temperatures and the timing of the spring plankton bloom could affect the biological clocks of many marine species, which spawn at specific times of the year based on environmental cues like water temperature.\" This was observed in an earlier and longer-than-usual annual plankton bloom.

The total ice extent as of Aug. 31, 2012, 1.40 million square miles, is the smallest ice extent measured ever, surpassing the record low from 2007 of 1.54 million square miles. According to the NSIDC, during August, the Arctic lost an average of 35,400 square miles of ice per day, the fastest observed loss for the month of August on record. August 2012 marks the 16th consecutive August and the 135th consecutive month with below-average Arctic sea ice extent. \"We're now about 50 percent ice coverage compared to the period '79 to 2000,\" Dr. Andrew Carleton of Penn State University told AccuWeather. \"This means several things [for the climate]. It means, of course, it has melted so much, it has warmed up in the polar regions, especially in the arctic,\" Carleton said. \"When you remove a large amount of sea ice and when the sun is above the horizon, obviously in the summer time, this means that more polar energy gets absorbed by the ocean, so the ocean is warming up, and that means it is more difficult in the following winter to grow sea ice again.\" Sea ice models have predicted this melt to happen eventually, but were incorrect in the rapidity of the melt, he added. Outdated models, anywhere from 20-30 years old, predicted that the arctic ocean could become ice free by as late as 2075, but the melt has been occurring much more rapidly in the past decade. The impacts of such a change have not been confirmed. NOAA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center have not predicted its implications in their reports. The extent of the sea ice could be a catalyst for numerous scenarios, Carleton explained. \"It's likely that with more ocean exposed, particularly in the fall and the winter, there'll be more water vapor going into the atmosphere from the ocean, more heat. This could, in fact, energize storm systems in the middle to higher latitudes and lead to greater snow fall amounts,\" said Carleton. \"In the middle and high latitudes, it might actually increase blocking. It might increase the strength of the high pressure systems, so you might get greater regional variability.\" \"It's kind of a paradox that you could have more warming but you could also have increased amounts of ice on the ocean and in the winter time, and also increased storms. But again, its not clear if that would happen, it's just one possibility,\" Carleton said.

I have been getting a number of comments within this blog and even in the office asking why there was a recent daily record high sea ice area in the Antarctic despite the warming climate. Image below courtesy of the Polar Research Group from the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign. August trend of sea ice extent in the northern Hemisphere summer. August trend of sea ice extent in the southern hemisphere winter. Image courtesy of the NSIDC. According to the experts at the National Snow and Ice Data Center........... 1. The main reason that Antarctica and the Arctic are reacting differently to climate change is partly due to significant geographical differences. Antarctica is a continent surrounded by water, while the Arctic is basically ocean surrounded by land. 2. Wind and ocean currents surrounding Antarctica isolate the continent from global weather patterns, thus keeping it cold. The Arctic Ocean is much more linked with the climate systems around it, making it much more sensitive to climate change. 3. Almost all of the sea ice that forms around the Antarctic in the winter melts out each year as the sea ice is free to float northward into warmer waters. Nice explanation from the NSIDC ........ Is wintertime Antarctic sea ice increasing or decreasing? Wintertime Antarctic sea ice is increasing at a small rate and with substantial natural year-to-year variability. Specifically, the months of May, June, July, September and October show trends of increasing sea ice extent that are just slightly above the mean year-to-year variability. In more technical terms, the trends are statistically significant at the 95% level, although small. Climate model projections of Antarctic sea ice extent are in reasonable agreement with the observations to date. The dominant change in the climate pattern of Antarctica has been a gradual increase in the westerly circumpolar winds. Models suggest that both the loss of ozone (the ozone hole that occurs in September/October every year) and increases in greenhouse gases lead to an increase in this climate pattern. When winds push on sea ice, they tend to move it in the direction they are blowing, but the Coriolis effect adds an apparent push to the left. In the unconfined system of Antarctic sea ice, this pushes the ice northward away from the continent. By spreading sea ice westward and a little northward (and since we measure extent with a 15% cut-off) the gradual trend towards faster mean winds means a gradual trend toward spreading of the ice cover. Even if wintertime Antarctic sea ice were to increase or decrease significantly in the future, it would not have a huge impact on the climate system. This is because during the Antarctic winter energy from the sun is at its weakest point; its ability or inability to reflect the sun’s energy back into space has little affect on regulating the planet’s temperature. Also from the September 21st Christian Science Monitor article ....... \"Antarctic sea ice hasn't seen these big reductions we've seen in the Arctic. This is not a surprise to us,\" said climate scientist Mark Serreze, director of the NSIDC. \"Some of the skeptics say 'Well, everything is OK because the big changes in the Arctic are essentially balanced by what's happening in the Antarctic.' This is simply not true.\" \"Another reason why the sea-ice extent in the Antarctic is remaining fairly high is, interestingly, the ozone hole,\" Serreze told Life's Little Mysteries. This hole was carved out over time by chlorofluorocarbons, toxic chemicals formerly that were used in air conditioners and solvents before being banned. \"The ozone hole affects the circulation of the atmosphere down there. Because of the ozone hole, the stratosphere above Antarctica is quite cold. Ozone in the stratosphere absorbs UV light, and less absorption [by] ozone makes the stratosphere really cold. This cold air propagates down to the surface by influencing the atmospheric circulation in the Antarctic, and that keeps the sea ice extensive.\" But these effects are very small, and Antarctic sea-ice levels have increased only marginally. In the coming decades, climate models suggest rising global temperatures will overwhelm the other influences and cause Antarctic sea ice to scale back, too.

Image courtesy of Wikipedia. “Our record indicates that recent summer temperatures on Svalbard are greater than even the warmest periods at that (Medieval Period) time,\" said the study’s lead author, Dr. William D’Andrea, who is a climate scientist. Since 1987, the summers on Svalbard have averaged 2 to 2.5 degrees C. or (3.6 to 4.5 degrees F) higher than what they were during the warmest parts of the Medieval Warm Period (950 to 1250). The research team produced the 1,800 year climate record for the archipelago by analyzing levels of unsaturated fats in algae buried in sediments of a lake in western Svalbard. Most Arctic climate records come from ice cores, but they usually only cover cold-season temperatures. Lake sediments can give you a picture of how the climate varied for the rest of the year, according to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Key excerpts from the LDEO article................. In looking at how summers on Svalbard varied, researchers also discovered that the region was not particularly cold during another recent anomalous period - the \"Little Ice Age\" of the 18th and 19th centuries, when glaciers on Svalbard surged to their greatest extent in the last 10,000 years and glaciers in many parts of Western Europe also grew.They suggest that more snow, rather than colder temperatures, may have fed the growth of Svalbard glaciers. Evidence from tree rings and ice cores shows that southern Greenland and parts of North America were warmer from 950 to 1250 than today, with the Vikings taking advantage of ice-free waters to settle Greenland. Some regions also saw prolonged drought, including California, Nevada and the Mississippi Valley, leading some scientists to coin the term Medieval Climate Anomaly to emphasize the extreme shift in precipitation rather than temperature. A natural increase in solar radiation during this time was responsible for warming parts of the northern hemisphere, with a rise in volcanic activity from 1100 to 1260 causing milder winters, University of Massachusetts scientist Ray Bradley explained in a 2003 Perspective piece in Science. Bradley is a co-author of the Svalbard lake sediment study. Norwegian researchers estimate that average winter temperatures in Svalbard could rise as high as 10 degrees C. or 18 degrees F. by the end of the century.

Also last month, Antarctic sea ice achieved a record high maximum extent. Arctic Sea ice in the Arctic is now starting its annual increase as the sun dips toward the horizon. A total of 11.83 million sq/km of sea ice was lost in the Arctic this past melt season. The previous record loss was 10.65 million sq/km, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). The satellite record goes back to 1979. Air temperatures at the 925 mb level just above the Arctic Ocean averaged 2 to 5 C. (4 to 9 F.) above average for September 2012. One of the reasons for this was the increase in open water, which allows more of the sun's heat to be absorbed. September 2012 sea ice extent was 16% lower than the previous record low and 45% below the 30-year average (1981-2010). --The linear rate of decline for September since 1979 is now 13% per decade. --The Arctic sea ice volume for September likely reached a record low according to PIOMAS... Excerpts from the NSIDC report ...... Entering the melt season, a thinner ice cover made the Arctic sea ice cover more vulnerable to weather, such as the storm that tracked through the Arctic in early August. Because the ice was thin and already decaying by the time of the storm, it was quickly broken up and melted by winds and waves. Other than the August storm, the pressure pattern in 2012 does not appear to have been as favorable in promoting ice loss as was the case in 2007, and yet a new record low occurred. -- Only category 4-year old sea ice increased across the Arctic, when you compare the lowest extent years of 2007 with 2012. This 4-year ice will become 5-year ice as the ice growth season begins once again. However, only about 20% of the thicker, 5-year ice is left compared to what there was back in the 1980s.

Dr. Sharon Stammerjohn of INSTAAR, University of Colorado, provides a review of the differences between Arctic and Antarctic climate controls on sea ice and helps place the events in context. First, climate is warming over much of the Antarctic continent, as shown in several recent studies (e.g., Steig et al., 2009) and is related to Pacific Ocean warming (Ding et al., 2010) and circumpolar winds. Both warming and ozone loss act to strengthen the circumpolar winds in the south. This is due primarily to persistently cold conditions prevailing on Antarctica year-round, and a cold stratosphere above Antarctica due to the ozone hole. Stronger winds generally act to blow the sea ice outward, slightly increasing the extent, except in the Antarctic Peninsula region , where due to geography, winds from the north have also increased, pushing the ice southward. Thus, sea ice extent near the northwestern Antarctic Peninsula continues to decline rapidly, while areas in the Ross Sea and the southern Indian Ocean show significant increases (Stammerjohn et al., 2012). Comparing winter and summer sea ice trends for the two poles is problematic since different processes are in effect . An expansion of winter Antarctic ice could be due to cooling, winds, or snowfall, whereas Arctic summer sea ice decline is more closely linked to decadal climate warming.

Just focusing on the Canadian waters, the sea ice picture is also quite grim, with thicker, multi-year ice being replaced by thin, one-year ice which is much more susceptible to complete melting in the summer. Below, I will show a series of graphs from the Canadian Ice Service in regards to sea ice in different regions of Canada from this past season through this summer...... The graph below shows the annual total accumulated ice coverage for the Hudson Bay and Strait region since 1981 for the period from June 25th to August 27th. The green line is the 1981-2010 median. You can see that a clear downward trend began in the 1990s. The graph below shows the annual total accumulated ice coverage for the eastern Canadian Arctic region since 1981 for the period from June 25th to August 27th. The green line is the 1981-2010 median. You can also see that a clear downward trend began in the 1990s. The image below shows this season's (since May 14th) weekly sea ice coverage in the northwestern Canadian Arctic waters compared to the 1981-2010 median. Normally at this time of year the region should see about 55% ice coverage. The latest figure has it only at about 25%. The next image below shows the weekly sea ice coverage (%) in the Atlantic Canada waters from November 26th, 2011 to July 16th, 2012. As you can see, the ice coverage in that region ran well below normal this past season and I see no reasons as of yet why that will change next season. One reason is explained below..... Sea surface temperatures continue to run way above normal (>4 C) around Atlantic Canada. This is obviously having an impact on the fishing industry and will likely keep temperatures and humidity above normal this fall across much of the region. This will also likely delay the annual start of the sea ice season, which in turn could lead to another low season. However, atmospheric winds in the winter always have a big say in this, so I could be wrong. Finally, the Great Lakes. I covered this earlier in the year. Last season's lake ice coverage was pathetic. Normally, during the peak of the sea ice season we should have about 40% coverage, last winter the peak averaged closer to 10%, Oh, and to no surprise the Great Lakes are also running well above-normal (degrees C) in the lake surface temperature department and should do so through at least the fall. This sets up a greater potential for heavier than normal lake snows early in the winter season if we can get some sustained cold outbreaks. Last year the lakes were also warm, but as you well know, there was little in the way of sustained cold. ----- You can follow me on twitter right here @BrettAWX The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"215e72a2492e72593d1b5f56acd9c992de977e0d"}

According to Plumer it appears that the GOP has indeed made a pronounced shift....... Excerpts from Plumer's Washington Post blog....... The 2008 GOP platform certainly didn’t agree with liberals and environmentalists on everything. Far from it. The document put a heavy emphasis on nuclear power, which tends to cause some green groups to bristle (although many Democrats softened their opposition to atomic energy in the years that followed, in a failed effort to woo conservatives on climate policy). The platform also had harsh words for “doomsday climate change scenarios” and “no-growth radicalism.” Yet the 2008 GOP platform was, essentially, taking part in a debate over how best to tackle greenhouse gases—not about whether the climate was changing at all. Skip ahead to 2012, and the GOP platform takes a markedly different tone. That section devoted to climate change? Gone. Instead, the platform flatly opposes ”any and all cap and trade legislation” to curtail greenhouse gases. It demands that Congress “take quick action to prohibit the EPA from moving forward with new greenhouse gas regulations.” It criticizes the Obama administration’s National Security Strategy for ”elevat[ing] ‘climate change’ to the level of a ‘severe threat’ equivalent to foreign aggression.” The platform even tosses in what appears to be a subtle swipe at climate scientists.

Discovery News writer Kieran Mulvaney wanted to find out the latest on the relationship between climate change and hurricanes, so he decided to contact Professor Kerry Emanuel of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of the true experts on this subject. Emanuel has published extensively on the possible linkages between tropical storms and the warming planet, according to the article . Hurricane Isaac at night. Courtesy NASA. Here are a few excerpts from the Q & A between Mulvaney and Emanuel........... DNews : Is the theory behind this (global warming could mean more intense hurricanes) simply that a warming ocean provides greater energy for these storms to feed on? Is that a fair assessment? Kerry Emanuel : It’s almost fair. What drives hurricanes is the flow of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere, and that is proportional to the difference between the heat content of the two, rather than the absolute temperature in either of them. But it turns out that if you add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere – or indeed, if you were just able to increase the amount of sunlight coming in, one way or the other – that increases the difference and so increases the potential for hurricanes, so that they could become stronger, at least theoretically. DNews : And what would be the reason for the overall number of storms decreasing? Kerry Emanuel : This is an interesting question. It bears on a related question, which is, ‘Why don’t we have hurricanes everywhere all the time?’ And the fact is that hurricanes are, fortunately for us, fairly rare. And yet, the conditions for hurricanes are prevalent over much of the tropics through much of the year. We’ve learned in recent decades that what stops most ordinary, run-of-the-mill disturbances from turning into hurricanes is the relative dryness of the atmosphere a couple of miles above the surface. Normally, it’s pretty dry there, but the relevant quantity is the difference between how much water is there, and how much water could be there if the air were saturated, and we call that the saturation deficit. And that deficit increases with temperature. And because of that, as the temperature gets warmer and warmer, ironically it becomes more difficult to start a hurricane, even though once you start a hurricane, potentially it can become more intense, so you have these two contradictory things going on. Western Atlantic water vapor image showing dry air aloft (brown color) I will say that we have indeed seen a greater amount of dry air aloft getting entrained into several Atlantic storms recently, which has inhibited the intensification process. Whether or not climate change is partially to blame is really hard to say at this point.

The AMS is clearly making a stronger statement (compared to 2007) in regards to global warming and its cause, saying that the warming of the climate system now is unequivocal. Some key excerpts from the AMS policy statement...... There is unequivocal evidence that Earth’s lower atmosphere, ocean, and land surface are warming; sea level is rising; and snow cover, mountain glaciers, and Arctic sea ice are shrinking. The dominant cause of the warming since the 1950s is human activities. Climate is always changing. However, many of the observed changes noted above are beyond what can be explained by the natural variability of the climate. It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide. The most important of these over the long term is CO2, whose concentration in the atmosphere is rising principally as a result of fossil-fuel combustion and deforestation. Future warming of the climate is inevitable for many years due to the greenhouse gases already added to the atmosphere and the heat that has been taken up by the oceans. In the 21st century, global sea level also will continue to rise although the rise will not be uniform at all locations. With its large mass and high capacity for heat storage, the ocean will continue to slowly warm and thus thermally expand for several centuries. Model simulations project about 27 cm (10 inches) to 71 cm (28 inches) of global sea level rise due to thermal expansion and melting of ice in the 21st century. Atmospheric water content will increase globally, consistent with warmer temperatures, and consequently the global hydrological cycle will continue to accelerate. For many areas, model simulations suggest there will be a tendency towards more intense rain and snow events separated by longer periods without precipitation. However, changes in precipitation patterns are expected to differ considerably by region and by season.

Instead the researchers analyzed surface temperature data to establish the growing frequency of extreme heat events in the past 30 years, a period in which the temperature data show an overall warming trend. Hansen says this summer is shaping up to fall into the new extreme category. \"Such anomalies were infrequent in the climate prior to the warming of the past 30 years, so statistics let us say with a high degree of confidence that we would not have had such an extreme anomaly this summer in the absence of global warming,\" he says.

Melting on the Greenland Ice Sheet has already set a new record weeks before the normal end of the melt season, according to Professor Marco Tedesco of the Cryosphere Processes Laboratory, Dept. of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at The City College of New York. The cumulative melting index for the entire ice sheet on August 8th surpassed the record value that was set in 2010 for the entire melt season, which normally ends in early-mid September. You can view the chart on Professor Tedesco's blog right here. The melting index was determined through the use of passive microwave satellite measurements. Data goes back to 1979. Melting at the higher elevations of the Greenland Ice Sheet lasted 50-60 days longer than average so far this season. Key excerpt from Tedesco's Greenlandmelting.com blog........ An important point to mention is that the passive microwave sensors cannot tell us about the amount of surface mass loss from melting. They can only 'see' when and where melting is occurring but they become 'blind' when it comes down to estimating how much water was produced from that melting. This is why we use the 'melting index', in order to have an idea of the 'strength' of the melting season. In general, there is a good correspondence between the melting index and the surface mass loss on a seasonal basis. This year's final melt index will likely end up well above the old record before it's all said and done. ---------- Greenland Ice Sheet albedo (reflectivity) drops below 2 standard deviations Analysis by Dr. Jason Box from Byrd Polar Research Center shows that the ice reflectivity on the Greenland Ice Sheet has dropped well below normal.

The research team, lead by Dr Robert Mulvaney OBE, from British Antarctic Survey (BAS) showed that a slower, natural warming event began in this region about 600 years ago followed by an accelerated warming over the last 100 years. This is the first comprehensive reconstruction of a 15,000 year climate history from an ice core retrieved from James Ross Island in the Antarctic Peninsula region, according to the Eurekalert story. This particular region on Earth has warmed nearly 2 degrees C. in the past 50 years, making the Antarctic Peninsula one of the fastest warming places on the planet. The rapid warming in this region over the past 50-100 years coincides with present-day disintegration of ice shelves and glacier retreat, according to Dr. Mulvaney. Dr. Mulvaney also stated....... \"This is a really interesting result. One of the key questions that scientists are attempting to answer is how much of the Earth's recently observed warming is due to natural climate variation and how much can be attributed to human activity since the industrial revolution.\" \"......if this rapid warming that we are now seeing continues, we can expect that ice shelves further south along the Peninsula that have been stable for thousands of years will also become vulnerable,\" says Co-Author Dr Nerilie Abram formerly from British Antarctic Survey and now with the Research School of Earth Sciences, at The Australian National University.

The report focuses on the cooling influence of back-to-back La Ninas and the increase in extreme events globally. Global surface temperature anomalies for 2011, courtesy of NOAA. The peer-reviewed report, issued in coordination with the American Meteorological Society (AMS), was compiled by 378 scientists from 48 countries around the world. Here are some of the key excerpts from the NOAA report ....... Worldwide, 2011 was the coolest year on record since 2008, yet temperatures remained above the 30 year average...... La Nina chilled the eastern tropical Pacific in 2011, but ocean heat content nearly everywhere else was above the long-term average. La Nina influenced several severe weather events during 2011, such as the historic droughts in East Africa, the southern United States and northern Mexico, along with the wettest two-year period in Australia. Arctic Sea ice extent reached its second lowest summer minimum on record. Older Arctic sea ice (4 to 5 years old) reached a new record minimum at more than 80 percent below average. The report also focused on a total of 43 climate indicators to track and identify changes and overall trends to the global climate system, according to NOAA. Key excerpts about the global climate system........ Four independent datasets show 2011 among the 15 warmest since records began in the late 19th century, with annually-averaged temperatures above the 1981–2010 average, but coolest on record since 2008. The Arctic continued to warm at about twice the rate compared with lower latitudes. The surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet experienced dramatic melting during the summer of 2011. The melt detected between June-August was the third largest since satellite records began in 1979.... Carbon dioxide steadily increased in 2011 and the yearly global average exceeded 390 parts per million (ppm) for the first time since instrumental records began. ...temperatures in the polar stratosphere were lower than average during the early 2011 winter months. This led to the lowest ozone concentrations in the lower Arctic stratosphere since records began in 1979 with more than 80 percent of the ozone between 11 and 12 miles altitude destroyed by late March, increasing UV radiation levels at the surface..... NOAA has an excellent piece explaining the differences that we see in regards to temperature/sea ice trends between the Arctic and Antarctic. You can find it halfway down this page. The AMS also looked at the possible links between the extreme events of 2011 and climate change...... While scientists cannot trace specific events to climate change with absolute certainty, new and continued research help scientists understand how the probability of extreme events change in response to global warming.

Carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas and is a cause of global warming. Globally, CO2 emissions increased 3% in 2011, which is slightly higher than the past decades average annual increase of 2.7%. The global emissions of CO2 reached an all-time high of 34 billion tons in 2011, according to the full report. Breaking down the change in emissions for 2011......... A 9% increase in China (mainly due to increasing coal consumption). A 6% increase in India. A 3% decrease across the European union. A 2% decrease for the United States and also Japan. U.S. CO2 emissions by source NASA has an excellent explanation of the greenhouse effect below...... The Sun, which is the Earth's only external form of heat, emits solar radiation mainly in the form of shortwave visible and ultraviolet (UV) energy. As this radiation travels toward the Earth, the atmosphere absorbs about 25% of it, and about 25% is reflected by the clouds back into space. The remaining radiation travels unimpeded to the Earth and warms its surface. The Earth releases back to space the same amount of energy it has absorbed from the Sun. However, the Earth is much cooler than the Sun, so the energy re-emitted from the Earth's surface is much weaker, in the form of invisible longwave infrared (IR) radiation, sometimes called heat radiation. If you stand close to a hot object, but do not touch it, you can feel how the IR radiation heats your skin, although you cannot see the IR rays. Gases that absorb and trap this IR radiation, such as water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are known as \"greenhouse gases\". The atmosphere acts like the glass in a greenhouse, allowing much of the shortwave solar radiation to travel through unimpeded, but trapping a lot of the longwave heat energy trying to escape back to space. This process makes the temperature rise in the atmosphere just as it does in the greenhouse. This is the Earth's natural greenhouse effect and keeps the Earth 33 °C warmer than it would be without an atmosphere, at an average 15 °C (59° F). ---- The CO2 emissions report was based on results from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) You can also read a shorter summary on the report from EurekAlert right here.

The data visualization below shows the extent of surface melting in Greenland on July 8 (left) and July 12, 2012 Image courtesy of NASA. The main culprit to this event was a strong and persistent ridge of high pressure aloft that sat over Greenland, leading to an extended period of unusually warm weather. Below is a NASA MODIS high resolution satellite image from yesterday showing the southwestern coast of Greenland with the ice cap not too far inland. The NOAA image below shows the 500 mb height anomalies the first part of this month. The red indicated much higher heights than normal which is indicative of a persistent upper-level ridge of high pressure. The second NOAA image below shows the estimated surface temperature anomalies over Greenland in degrees C. for the first half of July. According to the NASA Earth observatory article...... Every summer, a fraction of the surface of the Greenland ice sheet naturally melts. At high elevations, most melt water quickly refreezes in place. Near the coast, some of the melt is retained by the ice sheet and the rest is lost to the ocean. Also, surface melting was observed around the 10,000+ foot Summit Station in central Greenland which is extremely rare. According to ice core analysis, this amount of melting at the summit has not happened since 1889. “Ice cores from Summit show that melting events of this type occur about once every 150 years,” said Lora Koenig, a NASA scientist and member of the team analyzing the satellite data. “With the last one happening in 1889, this event is right on time.

For 30 years, climate scientists have been “locked into a simple-minded identification of climate with greenhouse-gas level. … That climate should be the function of a single parameter (like CO2) has always seemed implausible. Yet an obsessive focus on such an obvious oversimplification has likely set back progress by decades,” Lindzen said. \"There is little evidence that changes in climate are producing extreme weather events....\" Real-world observations do not support IPCC models, he said: “We’ve already seen almost the equivalent of a doubling of CO2 (in radiative forcing) and that has produced very little warming.” He discounted mainstream opinion that climate change could hurt national security, saying that “historically there is little evidence of natural disasters leading to war, but economic conditions have He discounted mainstream opinion that climate change could hurt national security, saying that “historically there is little evidence of natural disasters leading to war, but economic conditions have proven much more serious. Lindzen also showed a graph that demonstrated that more energy consumption leads to higher literacy rate, lower infant mortality and a lower number of children per woman. Lindzen also said a 0.8 of a degree C change in temperature in 150 years is a small change. Questioned about five-, seven-, and 17-year averages that seem to show that Earth’s surface temperature is rising, he said temperatures are always fluctuating by tenths of a degree. I will add the while it is true that most of the fluctuations that we see from month to month and year to year are no more than tenths or hundred's of a degree there is clearly an upward trend which has accelerated especially over the past 20 years.

In order to answer that question correctly we need to break it down to sea and land ice. Land ice on Antarctica is made up of frozen freshwater from precipitation, while sea ice is mostly made up of frozen seawater. When sea ice melts it does not add to the sea level, but when land ice melts it does contribute to the sea level. We constantly talk about the sea ice up in the Arctic, but not in the Antarctic. Why is that? The big difference is the fact that the sea ice around Antarctica usually melts out completely during the summer. This results in very little energy balance change from year to year. In the Arctic, a relatively large amount of permanent sea ice remains during the summer, but longer term trends clearly show a significant decline of this sea ice in the Arctic during the summer and that is creating more of an energy imbalance as the expanding darker, open waters allow more and more heat to be absorbed. It is true that the sea ice is actually increasing around Antarctica, but this has very little impact since the amount of sea ice around Antarctica pales in comparison to the amount of land ice on Antarctica, which reflects most of the sun's energy in that region. There are a few reasons why the sea ice is increasing down in the Antarctic and some of that is due to overall warming. 1. Warming air temperatures lead to more snow/rain (warmer air holds more moisture). This increase in freshwater precipitation produces an ocean surface layer that is less dense than the warmer, saltier water from below. This results in less mixing and reduced melting of sea ice since the colder water remains at the surface. 2. A drop in ozone levels over Antarctica has cooled the stratosphere, which in turn increases the cyclonic winds that circle Antarctica. The increase in wind moves the sea ice around, leading to polynyas, which are areas of open water that can enhance more sea ice production. You can read more about this from Skeptical Science.com West Antarctica's ice sheets (land) are in rapid retreat, according to NASA's JPL, while East Antarctica has been relatively stable, though there has been a recent decline, according to one study. However, the continent of Antarctica as a whole has been losing more than 100 cubic kilometers (24 cubic miles) of land ice per year since 2002, and that could be a problem, according to NASA.

I recall blogging about this a few years ago. Most of the comments state that there is a warm bias, mainly due to advancing urbanization and poor siting of weather stations. We also hear that the massaged data is purposely adjusted upward to show the warming trend. Keep in mind, the area of the United States only takes up a very small percentage of the entire Earth, so even if the warm bias was true, it would have little if any impact on the global temperature trends. So what does the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) have to say about this in their U.S. temperature monitoring section? 1. There is no evidence that the U.S> temperature trend is inflated by poor siting of stations that are part of the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN). Over a thousand stations make up the USHCN. 2. There is indeed a bias associated with unadjusted data from poor exposure sites relative to data from good exposure sites. However, this bias is consistent with previous studies documenting the impact of the widespread conversion to electronic sensors during the last 25 years because the majority of poor exposure sites were subject to this instrument change. 3. These instrument changes actually led to an artificial negative (cool) bias in maximum temperatures and only a slight positive (warm) bias in minimum temperatures. Overall, the temperature adjustments leave a small, overall residual negative (cool) bias in the adjusted U.S. average maximum temperature, according to the NCDC. Change from afternoon to morning...... The greatest bias in the U.S. temperature record occurred with the systematic change in observing times from afternoon, when it is typically warm, to morning (cooler). This shift led to an increasing cool bias over the last several decades, which of course needed a major correction to be applied, according to the NCDC. Rural stations versus urban..... The NCDC identified Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) stations were rural and which were urban. Then they created global temperature time series from the rural only stations and compared that to our full dataset. The result was that the two showed almost identical time series (actually the rural showed a little bit more warming) so there apparently was no lingering urban heat island bias in the adjusted GHCN dataset. Globally adjusted temperature anomalies versus raw....... The top image below is the adjusted version of the GHCN and the bottom is the raw (unadjusted) version of the GHCN. Both clearly show a long-term, global warming trend and throws out the argument that the observed warming is due to the adjustment process. Adjusted. Images courtesy of the NCDC.

The report, which is the most sophisticated regional climate study ever undertaken was led by UCLA climate expert Alex Hall, who is an associate professor in UCLA's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences who is also a lead author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports. “These figures are only annual averages, and the day-to-day increase in temperatures will vary,\" said Hall. Hall's research team downsized a total of 22 global climate models to local levels. Each model had slightly different assumptions about how to predict climate change or factors like future greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UCLA newsroom. The team then analyzed the results and integrated them into an ensemble projection to create the forecast for the entire region. From UCLA........ \"We looked not only at a business-as-usual scenario where greenhouse gas emissions continue but also at a scenario where emissions are curtailed,\" Hall said. \"Even if we drastically cut pollution worldwide, there will still be quite a bit of warming in Los Angeles. I was a little taken aback by how much warming remains, no matter how aggressively we cut back. It was sobering.\" The results also show a tripling of the number of extremely hot days in the downtown area and quadrupling the number in the valleys and at high elevations by mid-century. Warming along the coastal areas of southern California are projected to be less than that of the interior valleys and mountains due to the high heat capacity of water.

I saw this press release from the Ohio State University in regards to statisticians using statistical analysis of different climate models in order to estimate projections of temperature changes and certainty for the years 2021 to 2070 across North America. From the Ohio State University Research News release..... “One of the criticisms from climate-change skeptics is that different climate models give different results, so they argue that they don’t know what to believe,” says Noel Cressie, professor of statistics and director of Ohio State’s Program in Spatial Statistics and Environmental Statistics. “We wanted to develop a way to determine the likelihood of different outcomes, and combine them into a consensus climate projection. We show that there are shared conclusions upon which scientists can agree with some certainty, and we are able to statistically quantify that certainty.” Using regional climate models' temperature values from 1971 to 2000 in addition to their projections for 2041 to 2070, the research team estimated that average land temperatures across North America will rise around 4.5 degrees F or 2.5 degrees C by 2070. Through this analysis, the team also determined that there is a 97.5% probability that average temperatures will rise by at least 3.6 degrees F or 2.0 degrees C over a large area of North America by 2070. You can see those maps right here. No surprise, the northeast part of North America in Canada is projected to see the greatest increase in temperatures over the winter with a rise of about 10.7 degrees F or 6.0 degrees C by 2070 as sea ice continues to diminish, allowing more of the sun's energy to be absorbed, instead of reflected back to space. Also from the OSU release....... Cressie cautioned that this first study is based on a combination of a small number of models. Nevertheless, he continued, the statistical computations are scalable to a larger number of models. The study shows that climate models can indeed be combined to achieve consensus, and the certainty of that consensus can be quantified. ---- Much more in depth discussion about this research can be found on the statisticians' website.

The remote, high latitude northern sites reached 400 ppm first in April and May, the peak of the natural CO2 cycle. Plant growth cycles remove the gas from the air during late spring and summer and add it back during fall, winter and early spring. This annual cycle is largest at Northern high latitudes. During June through August, CO2 will fall again, and next April and May it is expected be to 402 ppm or higher at the same northern sites. As mentioned earlier this year, atmospheric CO2 levels are currently higher than they have been at any time during the last 800,000 years.

In the study, Thomas Dietz and his colleague Eugene Rosa found that for each 1 percent increase in population there will be a bit more than a 1% increase in greenhouse emissions. “The effect of population size depends on consumption; the effects of consumption depend on how many people are consuming at that level.\" says Dietz, a Michigan State professor of sociology and environmental science and policy, and assistant vice president for environmental research. The wealth of a country was also found to be a factor. The more affluent nations use more resources, thus creating more emissions. However, people of the more affluent nations tend to be more socially conscious and are willing to work and pay for a cleaner environment, according to the Michigan State University news release. Excerpts from the MSU story...... “increased use of electricity generated by renewable sources that do not emit greenhouse gases might partially or wholly compensate for the tendency toward increased emissions that come with increased affluence,\" said Dietz. “However, these changes will need to be huge because they must counter substantial increases in scale coming from population growth and especially increasing affluence.” they wrote.

In order to maintain a safe and stable, global climate, most current research suggests keeping that value somewhere between 300 and 350 ppm. In order to achieve that, recent peer-reviewed research from the University of Michigan suggests that we’ll either have to put the brakes on economic growth or transform the way the world’s economies work. This is the first analysis to use measurable levels of atmospheric CO2 to assess fluctuations in the gas, rather than estimates of CO2 emissions, which are less accurate, according to the University of Michigan Sampler.

The satellite temperature record put out by the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH), which is one of three data sets that goes back to 1979 was found to have a data calibration problem. For instance, the UAH lower tropospheric temperature record is frequently cited by climate change skeptics, since it only shows a 0.13 F per decade warming in the tropics, while surface measurements show the increase to be 0.21 F per decade, according to the University of Washington. The other two satellite records of the troposphere, which are from Remote Sensing Systems and NOAA indicate a decadal warming trend in the tropics of 0.26 F and 0.33 respectively. The NOAA-9 satellite. The research team led by Stephen Po-Chedley, a UW graduate student in atmospheric sciences and Qiang Fu, a UW professor of atmospheric sciences found that the University of Alabama-Huntiville incorrectly factors in the changing temperature from a particular satellite (NOAA-9). The UW team was the first to come up with a calculation to correct the error. When the calculation was applied, the UAH decadal trend rose to 0.21F, which is much more in line with the other satellite trends and the surface trend. Now, the big question is whether or not UAH accepts the UW correction. The paper does not resolve all the discrepancies among the records, and researchers will continue to look at ways to reconcile those conflicts, according to the UW article.

Decreasing sea ice and an increase in soot has reduced the albedo in the Arctic, allowing more of the sun's energy to be absorbed at the surface.

While greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane warm the Earth's surface, tiny particles in the air (such as aerosols) can have the reverse effect on regional scales, according to the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences press release. Aerosol pollution reflects incoming sunlight, causing a cooling effect at the surface. Clouds in clean air are composed of a relatively small number of large droplets (below left). As a consequence, the clouds are somewhat dark and translucent. In air with high concentrations of aerosols, water can easily condense on the particles, creating a large number of small droplets (right). These clouds are dense, very reflective, and bright white.

The report took into account a synthesis of reports from thousands of scientists from 60 countries. The report is the first in over 50 years to offer a benchmark of conditions from the International Polar year (2007-2008). Worldwide, many oceanographers, meteorologists, geologists, climate scientists, ecologists and other researchers contributed to the report. Some of the significant findings from the report...... 1. A 27% loss of sea ice in a single year (2007). 2. Ice sheets around the poles are showing evidence of serious retreat and a this is expected to accelerate. 3. Seven of twelve Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves are either gone or are in severe decline. 4. Microscopic phytoplankton, which are at the base of the food chain have been found in North Atlantic waters where they have not been in 800,000 years. This is causing commercial and other fish species to migrate farther northward with the fishermen following. 5. Found a link that when the west Antarctic ice sheet collapses the Arctic warms up. \"This type of information makes the report all the more important because the changes we expect to see in the next few decades are going to be incredible, said Julie Brigham-Grette, co-chaired the NRC report.

The research team led by paleoclimatologist Jeremy Shakun, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fellow at Harvard and Columbia universities, looked at sediment cores collected from deep beneath the sea and from lakes as well as the tiny bubbles of ancient air trapped inside ice cores taken from Antarctica, Greenland and elsewhere, according to the Scientific American article. From this, the team created the first global set of temperature proxies from 20,000 to 10,000 years ago. Comparing the global set with the levels of carbon dioxide in ancient air bubbles that were trapped in ice cores revealed that global average temperatures started to rise at least a century after CO2 levels began to creep up. In the Antarctic, the warming temperatures actually preceded the CO2 rise, but there is a possible explanation for this. Local warming in the Antarctic may have been caused by a shutdown of ocean currents caused by massive glacial melt in the northern hemisphere as the report indicates. ------- This study was published in the journal Nature on April 5th.

According to new research, the world's oceans may be currently acidifying at a quicker rate than they have in the past 300 million years. The high output of global carbon emissions is turning our oceans more acidic. The oceans draw down excess carbon dioxide from the air and that reaction leads to the formation of carbonic acid. Normally, the carbonic acid is slowly neutralized by fossil carbonate shells on the seafloor, according to the National Science Foundation news release. Coral and plankton under threat If too much CO2 enters the ocean too quickly it causes a reduction of carbonate ions that corals and some plankton need for shell and reef-building. The researchers found evidence for only one period in the last 300 million years when the oceans changed as fast as today: the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM, according to the NSF. In the last hundred years, rising carbon dioxide from human activities has lowered ocean pH by 0.1 unit, an acidification rate at least 10 times faster than 56 million years ago, says lead author Bärbel Hönisch, a paleoceanographer at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

Losing more of the thicker sea ice makes the entire northern sea ice cap much more vulnerable to an overall, accelerated decline. According to the study, which was led by NASA's Joey Comiso, the area covered by multi-year ice has been shrinking by –17.2 percent per decade. The two NASA images below are quite striking. The first image shows the sea ice coverage from Nov-Jan 1980. The thicker, multi-year ice can be seen as bright white, while the average, thinner ice closer to the edges is either milky white or light blue. 1980 2012 By Jan 2012, you can see the dramatic reduction in the thicker, multi-year ice. Excerpts from the NASA Earth Observatory article...... The thickest “multi-year” ice survives through two or more summers, while young, seasonal ice forms over a winter and typically melts just as quickly as it formed. Scientists also describe a third category: “perennial” ice is all ice cover that has survived at least one summer. All multi-year ice is perennial ice, but not all perennial ice is multi-year ice. Comiso found that perennial ice extent has been shrinking at a rate of –12.2 percent per decade, while its area is declining at a rate of –13.5 percent per decade. These numbers indicate that multiyear ice is declining faster than the perennial ice that surrounds it. Key quote from Comiso via NASA EO...... “The Arctic sea ice cover is getting thinner because it’s rapidly losing its thick component,” Comiso said. “At the same time, the surface temperature in the Arctic is going up, which results in a shorter ice-forming season. It would take a persistent cold spell for multi-year sea ice to grow thick enough again to be able to survive the summer melt season and reverse the trend.” ----- The study was posted in the recent Journal Climate.

The Earth's energy imbalance is the difference between the amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth's surface and the amount returned to space as heat. If the imbalance is positive and more energy enters the system than exits, Earth grows warmer. If the imbalance is negative, the planet grows cooler.

Speaking of extent, the Arctic sea ice extent is still slightly growing after showing a sharp increase over the past few weeks. A big reason for this is a continuation of very cold weather and favorable winds over the Bering Sea. Sea ice extent in this region is well above normal, while most of the remainder of the Arctic is running well below normal.

Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere continue to steadily increase, according to NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory. The latest readings from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii indicate that atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have increased to 393.65 parts per million as of February 2012. Here are two common questions that NOAA has answered from their FAQ section........ What is the greenhouse effect? The Sun, which is the Earth's only external form of heat, emits solar radiation mainly in the form of shortwave visible and ultraviolet (UV) energy. As this radiation travels toward the Earth, the atmosphere absorbs about 25% of it, and about 25% is reflected by the clouds back into space. The remaining radiation travels unimpeded to the Earth and warms its surface. The Earth releases back to space the same amount of energy it has absorbed from the Sun. However, the Earth is much cooler than the Sun, so the energy re-emitted from the Earth's surface is much weaker, in the form of invisible longwave infrared (IR) radiation, sometimes called heat radiation. If you stand close to a hot object, but do not touch it, you can feel how the IR radiation heats your skin, although you cannot see the IR rays. Gases that absorb and trap this IR radiation, such as water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are known as \"greenhouse gases\". The atmosphere acts like the glass in a greenhouse, allowing much of the shortwave solar radiation to travel through unimpeded, but trapping a lot of the longwave heat energy trying to escape back to space. This process makes the temperature rise in the atmosphere just as it does in the greenhouse. This is the Earth's natural greenhouse effect and keeps the Earth 33 °C warmer than it would be without an atmosphere, at an average 15 °C (59° F). How can minor atmospheric gases have such a large impact on climate? The major gases, nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and argon (Ar), which together comprise about 99.8% of the atmosphere, do not absorb visible light, nor infrared light. If the atmosphere contained only those three gases, the radiation would go right through without any effect on the heating of the atmosphere or surface. That leaves it to the minor gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and others to absorb infrared light. The total mass of the atmosphere is very large, about 5 x 1021 grams, or 5 million times a billion metric ton. The amounts of the minor gases are therefore still very large, sufficient to cause the absorption of a major fraction of infrared light in the atmosphere.

The scientists in this study expanded on previous research in regards to this topic by combining observational data and computer model simulations to find a link between recent high snowfall in the northern hemisphere and diminishing sea ice in the Arctic. The team found that the decrease in autumn Arctic sea ice between 1979-2010 corresponded strongly to above-normal winter snow over large parts of the northern united States, NW and central Europe and northern/central China. Two possible main factors for this link due to low sea ice coverage... 1. Atmospheric circulation changes 2. Changes in atmospheric water vapor content Excerpt from the EurekAlert report.... \"We think the recent snowy winters could be caused by the retreating Arctic ice altering atmospheric circulation patterns by weakening westerly winds, increasing the amplitude of the jet stream and increasing the amount of moisture in the atmosphere,\" explained Jiping Liu, a senior research scientist in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech. \"These pattern changes enhance blocking patterns that favor more frequent movement of cold air masses to middle and lower latitudes, leading to increased heavy snowfall in Europe and the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States.\" The map below (North America on top) shows the percent change in winter blockings relative to the long-term average. Blocking patterns favor more frequent movement of cold air masses to middle and lower latitudes. Image courtesy of Georgia Tech and Jiping Liu. For what it is worth, (yes, I know it is only one season) there was a distinct lack of high latitude blocking over the pole and on the Canadian side of the Arctic this winter despite another season of near-record low sea ice extent in the Arctic. Also, it is obvious at this time that the winter of 2011-2012 did not follow this plan, especially over the U.S. and Canada, which showed a distinct lack of snow and cold, so I personally believe that we need to have a much larger sample size (another 15-20 years of data) before we can be more certain of the link. You can be sure that I will continue to follow the sea ice, snow cover and atmospheric patterns in the far north very closely. ----------- The study was just published in the online early edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

In response to these claims, NASA scientists have presented reasons for this latest leveling out of the global temperature and a lot of it has to due with the strong interannual variability of the El Nino and La Nina phases. Note the important graph from NASA. Excerpts from NASA GISS below...... Hansen et al. (2010) showed that the correlation of 12-month running-mean global temperature and Niño 3.4 index is maximum with global temperature lagging the Niño index by 4 months. Thus the 1997-1998 \"El Niño of the century\" had a timing that maximized 1998 global temperature. In contrast, the 2011 global temperature was dragged down by a strong La Niña. Indeed, the strength of the current double-bottomed La Niña, being based on ocean surface temperature relative to base period 1951-1980, is under-emphasized by the long-term trend toward higher temperature. Thus, although the current global warming graphs are suggestive of a slowdown in global warming, this apparent slowdown may largely disappear as a few more years of data are added. In particular we need to see how high global temperature rises in response to the next El Niño, and we also need to consider the effect of the 10-12 year cycle of solar irradiance. Dr. James Hansen and others were on to something back in 2010........ Hansen et al. (2010) argued, in anticipation of the inevitable shift from the then beginning La Niña to the next El Niño, that \"The 12-month running mean global temperature in 2010 has reached a new record level for the period of instrumental data. It is likely that the 12-month mean will begin to decline in the second half of 2010. The subsequent minimum in the 12-month running mean is likely to be in 2011-2012 and not as deep as the 2008 minimum. The next maximum, likely to be in 2012-2014, will probably bring a new record global temperature, because of the underlying warming trend.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"90babc2eade0a19e9434885585d499f2012553a1"}

According to GISS, the combined global land/ocean surface temperature anomaly was +0.36 C or +0.65 F, which makes January 2012 the third coolest January since 2000. As you can see by the January 2012 temperature anomaly map from GISS below, Alaska was incredibly cold last month, while much of the rest of the far northern latitudes were unseasonably warm, including much of the Lower 48 states.

La Nina does have a cooling effect on overall global temperatures, so the downward trend in global temperature anomalies is not a surprise. In fact, Jan 2008 was colder during the previous La Nina, making last year the warmest La Nina year on record. Based on long range forecasts for El Nino/La Nina it appears that we are headed for neutral conditions latter this spring with a small chance of a weak El Nino later in the year.

The slow growth likely stemmed from winds from the south and west that compressed the sea ice in the Barents Sea, and above-average temperatures and winds that limited ice growth in the Sea of Okhotsk, according to the NSIDC sea ice news. Also, the Arctic sea ice extent for January 2012 was the fourth lowest in the satellite record. As you can see by the NSIDC graph below, despite the slight increase from January 2011, there is still a clear downward trend since 1979. Here is a graph showing the January sea ice extent anomalies in the Southern Hemisphere for January going back to 1979. As you can see there is a slight upward trend. I encourage you to read more about the Antarctic Sea Ice and climate right here , courtesy of the NSIDC. Antarctic sea ice is governed more by wind than by temperature. ---------- The influence of the Arctic Oscillation on Sea Ice The NSIDC attached an interesting piece on the influence of the Arctic Oscillation on the movement of sea ice in the Arctic and how much ice melts in the summer. If you remember, there was an extremely strong and long duration positive Arctic Oscillation from November 2011 to mid-January 2012 before it turned slightly negative later in January and into February. The NSIDC goes on and states............ In December, when the AO was in its positive phase, ice was flowing from Siberia toward North America, and also south out of the Arctic through Fram Strait. That pattern favors a thinner, younger ice cover in the summer. In mid-January, the AO switched to its negative phase. In general, the negative phase of the AO tends to retain ice in the Arctic Ocean, leading to a stronger, more resilient summer sea ice cover. Ice motion charts for January confirm that in January, there was less motion across the pole and through Fram Strait but a stronger clockwise motion in the Beaufort Sea called the Beaufort Gyre.

The research team compared temperature data from 1975-2000 with similar data from 1950-1974 and determined that these observations along with results from running 16 climate models shows that episodes of extreme summertime heat that was once rare will occur in more than 50% of summers by mid-century across the Lower 48 states.

Andrew Weaver and colleague Neil Stewart found that if all the hydrocarbons in the oil sands were mined and consumed, the carbon dioxide released would raise global temperatures by about .36 degrees C. That's about half the total amount of warming over the last century, according to the Winnipeg Free Press article. When only commercially viable oil sands deposits are considered, the temperature increase is only .03 degrees C, according to the story. If all of the abundant natural gas in the world was burned it would warm the planet by at least 3 degrees celsius. Surprisingly, burning all of the oil in the world would only raise the temperature by less than one degree C. Emissions from burning coal are a much bigger problem According to the paper, which was published in the journal Nature, the clear threat is the burning of coal. The research team concludes that burning all the globe's vast coal deposits would create a whopping 15-degree increase in temperature. Excerpt from the Free Press............ \"This idea that we're going to somehow run out of coal and natural gas and fossil fuels is really misplaced. We'll run out of human ability to live on the planet long before we run out of them,\" said Weaver. ------ Note : this analysis only accounts for emissions from burning the fuel. It doesn't count greenhouse gases released by producing the resource because that would double-count those emissions. (via the Canadian Press and Winnipeg Free Press) Clearly, there are serious, regional environmental concerns in regards to the oil sands, but this report just focuses on the potential impact on global temperatures from the emissions of the oil sands, especially when compared to the burning of coal.

Bob Smerbeck, who is a colleague of mine here at AccuWeather.com recently attended a seminar at Penn State University by Dr. Harold Brooks of the National Severe Storms Laboratory. In the seminar, Dr. Brooks addressed his ongoing research that deals with the connection between severe weather and climate change. Below are some of the more major points from the seminar that Bob Smerbeck was able to note......... 1. The large variability from one severe weather season to another, combined with ever improving and easier ways of reporting severe weather, make it difficult to link severe weather and climate change. 2. Significant severe weather (tornadoes and hail storms) depend more on wind shear (change in direction of strong winds with height) rather than a combination of heat and high humidity. Shear also determines the intensity of hail and tornadoes in the U.S. and Europe. Big tornado years have hail storms as the dominant secondary severe weather events (as opposed to just damaging winds). 3. Climate models projecting a future warmer world with C02 doubled show an increase in heat and humidity, but a decrease in shear (a decrease in equator to pole gradient). 4. These high heat/humidity & low shear environments result in little overall change in severe thunderstorms. However, there may be a slight decrease in tornadoes due to less shear and an increase in significant thunderstorm straight-line wind events due to an increase in heat and humidity. By the way, Dr. Brooks also mentioned that the downward trend in tornado deaths since the 1920's has leveled off over the past 30 years because of an increase in people living in mobile homes.

In reply, Mann insists that he has been as open as he can about data and methodology, but the aim of these requests has more to do with intimidation than openness. \"What they are trying to do is to blur the distinction between private correspondence and scientific data and methods, which of course should be out there for other scientists to attempt to reproduce. \"When we first published our Nature article (with the Hockey stick temperature graph) in 1998, we went back six centuries,\" Mann says. \"A year later we published a follow-up going back 1,000 years with quite a few caveats.

Well, it appears that the UK's Daily Mail last Sunday published a misleading story about this paper and titled it \"Forget Global Warming - it's Cycle 25 we need to worry about.\" The Daily Mail's story by David Rose drew plenty of attention across the globe. The sad part is that the UK Met Office actually spoke to Mr. Rose about the paper before he wrote his article, so Mr. Rose had plenty of opportunity to ask questions and get the story right. The UK Met Office was obviously not amused by the Daily Mail's version of the story and issued a press release noting the numerous errors in reporting. Here is the link to the actual UK Met response. Here are a few excerpts from the Met office response to the Daily Mail story..... This (Daily Mail) article includes numerous errors in the reporting of published peer reviewed science undertaken by the Met Office Hadley Centre and for Mr. Rose to suggest that the latest global temperatures available show no warming in the last 15 years is entirely misleading.

However, despite the change in the Arctic Oscillation from last winter to this winter, Arctic sea ice extent is still well below normal and running fairly close to the record low season of 2006-2007, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Interesting commentary from the NSIDC below......... The past two Arctic winters were dominated by a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation, a large-scale weather pattern that brings generally warm conditions to the Arctic and colder conditions to Europe and North America. In contrast, the winter of 2011 has so far seen a mostly positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation. While temperatures were above normal in the Kara and Barents seas, the positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation tends to keep the coldest winter air locked up in the Arctic, which keeps the middle latitudes free of frigid Arctic temperatures and strong snowstorms. This weather pattern helps to explain the low snow cover and warm conditions over much of the United States and Eastern Europe so far this winter. Several studies have shown that during the positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation, thick ice tends to move out of the Arctic through Fram Strait, leaving the Arctic with thinner ice that melts out more easily in summer. Scientists will be watching closely for this connection if the positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation continues through the winter. Some scientists have speculated that the negative Arctic Oscillation pattern of the last two winters was in part driven by low sea ice extent. The recurrence of the positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation so far this winter, following a near-record low summer sea ice extent, does not support this thinking. By the way, the AO has trended back to neutral and should stay close to or slightly below that through early February. Image courtesy of the NSIDC. Check out the NSIDC image below, which shows the plot of the 2011 Arctic sea ice extent measured against the new 30-year climatology (1981-2010) and the old 1979-2000 average.

Temperature records need to be at least 17 years long in order to distinguish man-made global warming from the usual \"noise\". \"Noise\" is basically normal climate fluctuations within a longer term trend. Temperature anomalies in a warming or cooling climate never rise or drop in a straight line over the longer term. Obviously, we have recently had some misinformed folks out there that jump on this \"noise\" to make a proclamation that global warming has ceased. Scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Lab analyzed satellite measured temperature data (the same data that some global warming skeptics seem only to believe is accurate) and found that the lower troposphere has warmed by 0.9 F since 1979 (beginning of the satellite record). According to the LLNB team the 0.9 F warming is entirely consistent with the warming of the earth's surface, which is estimated from temperature records by the NCDC, GISS and HadCrut3.

They find that tropospheric temperature records must be at least 17 years long to discriminate between internal climate noise and the signal of human-caused changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere. \"One individual short-term trend doesn't tell you much about long-term climate change,\" Santer said. \"A single decade of observational temperature data is inadequate for identifying a slowly evolving human-caused warming signal. In both the satellite observations and in computer models, short, 10-year tropospheric temperature trends are strongly influenced by the large noise of year-to-year climate variability.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"1cf5898c8761ab856013071e088546ad784fb3e2"}

Current scientific consensus states that the act of deforestation will contribute to global warming. By cutting down the trees, you do release heat trapping carbon, but you also increase the albedo (reflectivity of the ground surface) during the day since most of the forests in the north are evergreen, which is fairly dark. However, at night, without the albedo effect open land continued to cool faster than forests, which force warm turbulent air from aloft to the ground. Excerpts from the EurekAlert story ...... North of 45 degrees, approximately the northern border of Vermont, temperatures recorded in forest interiors were warmer than temperatures recorded in open areas. This is largely because year-round night time temperatures in forests remain higher than open areas due to the mixing down of warm air aloft in forests. In addition, snow-covered open areas reflect sunlight while dark forests absorb sunlight and its warmth. South of 45 degrees, maximum daytime temperatures in forested lands were lower than over nearby open land, but forest nighttime minimum temperatures were still higher. South of 35 degrees, approximately the southern border of Tennessee, the overall effect was reversed, with forests cooler than open land. The net cooling after deforestation north of 45 degrees latitude was 1.5 degrees F. ---------- Have a happy, safe Thanksgiving!

The research team from Yale and Purdue Universities looked at molecules from ancient, deep sea algae to come up with their findings. Image from Wikipedia. From the Purdue University News release....... The team found the tipping point in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels for cooling that initiates ice sheet formation is about 600 parts per million. Prior to the levels dropping this low, it was too warm for the ice sheet to form. At the Earth's current level of around 390 parts per million, the environment is such that an ice sheet remains, but carbon dioxide levels and temperatures are increasing. The world will likely reach levels between 550 and 1,000 parts per million by 2100. Melting an ice sheet is a different process than its initiation, and it is not known what level would cause the ice sheet to melt away completely, according to Matthew Huber, a professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Purdue. \"The models got it just about right and provided results that matched the information obtained from the core samples,\" he said. \"This was an important validation of the models.

One thing is for sure, the surface melt on the Greenland Ice Sheet during the summer of 2011 was greater than the long-term average, according to the NASA Earth Observatory story. The 2011 season experienced either the third or sixth most extensive melting year since satellite records began in 1979. The NOAA image below shows the melt season anomaly days for 2011.

This makes November 2011 the coolest November globally for the lower troposphere since 2000. We have not been able to say the word \"coolest\" too often in the recent past.

What happened? The number of Americans who believe the earth is warming dropped to 59 percent last year from 79 percent in 2006, according to polling by the Pew Research Group. (via NYT) The first thing that comes to my mind is the poor economy, large deficits and the unemployment problems, which are to most people a more pressing need at this time. Elisabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times wrote an interesting piece for the Sunday Review on this subject as she explores the reasons for the change in thinking in America compared to the rest of the world. Here are some excerpts from the NYT's article. ....... Americans — who produce twice the emissions per capita that Europeans do — are in many ways wired to be holdouts. We prefer bigger cars and bigger homes. We value personal freedom, are suspicious of scientists, and tend to distrust the kind of sweeping government intervention required to confront rising greenhouse gas emissions. The United States is the “one significant outlier” on responding to climate change, according to a recent global research report produced by HSBC, the London-based bank. John Ashton, Britain’s special representative for climate change, said in an interview that “in the U.K., in Europe, in most places I travel to” — but not in the United States — “the starting point for conversation is that this is real, there are clear and present dangers, so let’s get a move on and respond.” After watching the Republican candidates express skepticism about global warming in early September, former President Bill Clinton put it more bluntly, “I mean, it makes us — we look like a joke, right?” “Climate change presents numerous ideological challenges to our culture and our beliefs,” Professor Hoffman of the Erb Institute says. “People say, ‘Wait a second, this is really going to affect how we live!’ ” In the United States, the right wing of the Republican Party has managed to turn skepticism about man-made global warming into a requirement for electability, forming an unlikely triad with antiabortion and gun-rights beliefs. In private, scientific advisers to Mr. Obama say he and his administration remain committed to confronting climate change and global warming. But Robert E. O’Connor, program director for decision, risk and management sciences at the National Science Foundation in Washington, said a bolder leader would emphasize real risks that, apparently, now feel distant to many Americans. “If it’s such an important issue, why isn’t he talking about it?” The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"74be0c379cd2f6f06da10bcef9a6eb1a42ea91bf"}

The research team collected data for this study during a four-week expedition to the Jakobshavn Isbrae Glacier in western Greenland. Microwave satellite recordings and output from a model of the ice sheet were also used in the study. A lateral moraine can be seen at the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet near Thule Air Base.

Albedo describes the amount of solar energy absorbed by the surface (e.g. snow, slush, or patches of exposed ice). A white blanket of snow reflects much of the sun’s energy and thus has a high albedo. Bare ice – being darker and absorbing more light and energy – has a lower albedo, according to The City College of New York report. “We are finding that even if you don’t have record-breaking highs, as long as warm temperatures persist you can get record-breaking melting because of positive feedback mechanisms,” said Professor Tedesco, who directs CCNY’s Cryospheric Processes Laboratory and also serves on CUNY Graduate Center doctoral faculty.

Previous scientific studies using computer models predicted that trees will migrate to higher latitudes and elevations in response to the long-term warming. Unfortunately, this new research has shown that the expected northward migration of tree species in the eastern U.S. has been mostly absent. If the trees do not migrate in the warming climate then we can probably expect to see a much greater loss in certain tree populations.

The Pacific Decadal Oscillation or PDO is similar to the El Nino Southern Oscillation in that it is characterized by changes in sea surface temperature, sea level pressure and wind patterns. The PDO is described as being in one of two phases, a warm phase and a cool phase. The PDO index value is positive for warm phase conditions and negative for cool phase conditions. The images below show what the Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies are typically like during the warm and cool phases of the PDO. The second image shows the latest northern Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies, and you can see that current conditions certainly more reflect the cool phase of the PDO. Sea surface temperatures are well below normal off the BC and Pacific Northwest coast. According to the University of Washington, the latest PDO index number from September 2011 was -1.79, which is the lowest it has been since January of 2000. Image courtesy of the University of Washington. One significant difference between the PDO and ENSO is the fact that the PDO can remain in one phase for 20-30 years, while the ENSO alternates much more frequently. The PDO was only identified back in 1996, so there is still a clear lack of understanding about how the PDO works and its impacts on climate. Recently, the PDO was in an extended warm phase from 1977 to at least 1998, then it began to shift toward negative in 1999, but surprisingly it went back to positive in the mid 2000's before going back to negative in 2008. Was 2008 the start of a long term (20-30 years) cool phase of the PDO? Time will tell. What are some known impacts of the cool phase of the PDO across Canada and the Pacific Northwest? 1. Enhanced snowpack Pacific Northwest and Rockies. 2. Generally cooler and wetter for the Pacific Northwest. 3. Cooler James Bay in the summer. 4. Greater productivity of Chinook and Coho Salmon in Oregon Rivers. 5. Precipitation and Temperature patterns across BC are more exacerbated (more extremes) during years when the PDO and the ENSO are in the same phase. Right now, the PDO and ENSO (La Nina) are both in cool phases. 6. Often, cool phase PDO's intensify La Nina events, while moderating El Nino events. How about climate change? I saw this excerpt from a story in JamesBay.org from 2008 in regards to the PDO....... If lower sea surface temperatures (SST) off the coast of North America, which characterize the cool mode of the PDO, do indeed translate into somewhat cooler, albeit muted, local and regional temperatures (in BC), the longer-term climate change signal becomes masked — more difficult to detect and quantify (Figure 3). Climate scientist and oceanographer Josh Willis of JPL concludes that: “These natural climate phenomena can sometimes hide global warming caused by human activities. Or they can have the opposite effect of accentuating it.” This underscores the importance of collecting consistent and long-term weather records, as only data records that span at least one full cycle of the PDO will reveal the coherent “signal” of climate change that is contained within all natural climate variability.

The urban heat island effect is caused mostly by replacing soil and vegetation with paved roads, sidewalks and buildings. Paving prevents evaporation of water from the soil and plant leaves. Since evaporation is a cooling process, reducing evaporation warms cities. Additionally, the darker colors of some roads and buildings absorb more sunlight, heating a city further. (via EurekAlert) Image courtesy of WeatherQuestions.com. Researchers from Stanford University have determined that the urban heat island contribution global warming is actually quite small compared to greenhouse gases. \"Between 2 and 4 percent of the gross global warming since the Industrial Revolution may be due to urban heat islands,\" said Mark Z. Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering who led the study. He and graduate student John Ten Hoeve compare this with the greenhouse gas contribution to gross warming of about 79 percent and the black carbon contribution of about 18 percent. (via EurekAlert) \"This study shows that the urban heat island effect is a relatively minor contributor to warming, contrary to what climate skeptics have claimed,\" Jacobson said. \"Greenhouse gases and particulate black carbon cause far more warming.\" (via EurekAlert) The study modeled climate response from 2005 to 2025 and accounted not only for local impacts of the heat island effect, but also feedbacks of the effect to the global scale, according to Jacobson. Another interesting part to this EurekAlert story.... One \"geoengineering\" proposal for reducing the impact of urban heat islands is to paint roofs worldwide a reflective white. Jacobson's computer modeling concluded that white roofs did indeed cool urban surfaces. However, they caused a net global warming, largely because they reduced cloudiness slightly by increasing the stability of the air, thereby reducing the vertical transport of moisture and energy to clouds. In Jacobson's modeling, the reduction in cloudiness allowed more sunlight to reach the surface. \"There does not seem to be a benefit from investing in white roofs,\" said Jacobson. \"The most important thing is to reduce emissions of the pollutants that contribute to global warming.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"b50eb3aa5658e3624694f8084cbd29337f5dea0b"}

The minimum this year occurred on September 9th. Since September 9th there has been a steady recovery in sea ice extent in the Arctic due to colder weather and changing wind. Melt season in 2011 brought higher-than-average summer temperatures, but not the unusual weather conditions that contributed to the extreme melt of 2007, the record low. “Atmospheric and oceanic conditions were not as conducive to ice loss this year, but the melt still neared 2007 levels,” said Walt Meier of NSIDC. “This probably reflects loss of multi-year ice in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, as well as other factors that are making the ice more vulnerable.” (via NASA Earth Observatory) The sea ice area did drop slightly lower than 2007 levels for about ten days in early September 2011.

A 12-year study by the University of Michigan, which took place at an experimental forest in northeastern Wisconsin showed that North American forests have a greater capacity to absorb carbon dioxide gas than researchers previously anticipated, according to the EurekAlert story. To simulate atmospheric conditions expected in the latter half of this century, Zak and his colleagues continuously pumped extra carbon dioxide into the canopies of trembling aspen, paper birch and sugar maple trees at a 38-acre experimental forest in Rhinelander, Wis., from 1997 to 2008, according to EurekAlert. Carbon dioxide has a fertilizing effect on trees, making them grow faster than they normally would. It was assumed that over the coming decades that this fertilizing effect would be temporary in the northern forests as the growth rate of trees would grind to a halt as the trees would no longer be able to extract essential nitrogen from the soil. However, in this new study the trees bathed in elevated carbon dioxide continued to grow at an accelerated rate throughout the 12-year experiment. In the final three years of the study, the CO2-soaked trees grew 26 percent more than those exposed to normal levels of carbon dioxide. \"The greater growth has been sustained by an acceleration, rather than a slowing down, of soil nitrogen cycling,\" Lead author Donald Zak said. \"Under elevated carbon dioxide, the trees did a better job of getting nitrogen out of the soil, and there was more of it for plants to use.\" (via EurekAlert) ----------- This paper is published online this week in Ecology Letters.

Those trees that are planted in parks and streets in major cities keep the cities cooler than what they would normally be without them, but those same trees also have a cooling influence on the globe. Previously, the global climate effects of changes in evaporation have not been well understood. Researchers from Carnegie's Global Ecology Department, which undertook this particular study, even thought it was possible that evaporation could have a warming effect on global climate, because water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Also, the energy taken up in evaporating water is released back into the environment when the water vapor condenses and returns to earth, mostly as rain. Globally, this cycle of evaporation and condensation moves energy around, but cannot create or destroy energy. So, evaporation cannot directly affect the global balance of energy on our planet. (via EurekAlert) Using a climate model, the research team found that increased evaporation actually had an overall cooling effect on the global climate. Increased evaporation tends to cause clouds to form low in the atmosphere, which act to reflect the sun's warming rays back out into space. This has a larger scale cooling influence. ------ The Carnegie Science News article can be found right here. You can also read the full article from EurekAlert right here.

Image courtesy of the NCDC. Using computer simulations of the global climate, scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Research have determined that the deep oceans of the world could be the reason. Oceans with a depth of over 1000 feet may be able to absorb enough heat to level off the rate of global warming for periods as long as a decade, within a long-term period of overall warming. “We will see global warming go through hiatus periods in the future,” says NCAR’s Gerald Meehl, lead author of the study. “However, these periods would likely last only about a decade or so, and warming would then resume. This study illustrates one reason why global temperatures do not simply rise in a straight line.” (via UCAR) The new study suggests that the oceans might be storing some of the heat that would otherwise go toward other processes, such as warming the atmosphere or land, or melting more ice and snow. Observations from a global network of buoys showed some warming in the upper ocean, but not enough to account for the global build-up of heat, according to the UCAR article. During these hiatus periods the simulations showed that extra energy entered the oceans, with deeper layers absorbing a disproportionate amount of heat due to changes in oceanic circulation. The vast area of ocean below about 1,000 feet warmed by 18% to 19% more during hiatus periods than at other times. In contrast, the shallower global ocean above 1,000 feet warmed by 60% less than during non-hiatus periods in the simulation, according to UCAR.

A warming world should produce more precipitation. Precipitation is the single most efficient way of removing particulate pollution, according to the lead author of the study Timothy Garrett. The Arctic has been warming much more rapidly than the rest of the planet. Air pollutants mostly travel northward from industrialized regions to the Arctic. Thanks to global warming and the resulting increase in precipitation more pollution is already removed from the air by the time it reaches the Arctic, according to the National Geographic article . Cleaner air could mean a cooler Arctic The decrease in air pollution would also reduce the amount of soot in the air which would have a cooling effect on the Arctic.

But, even if the NCAR computer simulations are correct, the level of Arctic sea ice loss observed in recent decades cannot be explained by natural causes alone, and that the ice will eventually disappear during summer if climate change continues, according to the study. NCAR scientist Jennifer Kay explains that variations in atmospheric conditions such as wind patterns could, for example, temporarily halt the sea ice loss. Still, the ultimate fate of the ice in a warming world is clear, according to the UCAR article. “When you start looking at longer-term trends, 50 or 60 years, there’s no escaping the loss of ice in the summer,” Kay says.

By analyzing multiple realizations of the 20th century from a single climate model, they attribute approximately half the observed decline to human emissions of greenhouse gases, and the other half to climate variability, according to the UCAR story. This combination of climate change and variability working together equally led to the acceleration of Arctic sea ice loss during the late 20th century.

There seems to be a great lack in trust when it comes to these models, even though they are a necessary and powerful tool when it comes to predicting our future climate. So, what is a climate model? The good folks at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Labrotory (GFDL) in Princeton, NJ who work with these models on a daily basis can help us out. Climate models are tools that help scientists understand and predict climate behavior from seasonal to centennial time scales, according to the GFDL. These tools also assist governments with critical decision making. Image courtesy of the GFDL. The substantial increase of computing power of the supercomputers has allowed for a much finer resolution due to the increase of three dimensional grid cells across the earth's surface and atmosphere. The GFDL images below show the increase of model resolution (number of grids) from the 1980's to 2009. ---- Climate models can also tell us how much of climate change is due to human activity compared to natural variability. According to the GFDL, a climate model looks at the four major earth climate system components and their interactions. The four major components..... 1. Atmosphere 2. Land Surface 3. Ocean 4. Sea Ice Generally, models produce simulations of current and past large-scale climates that agree with observations. Climate models have also produced an accurate hindcast of 20th century climate change, including increased warming partly due to CO2 emissions. This performance gives scientists, such as those at the GFDL, confidence in using these tools to predict future climate change.

Did climate change play any role? There is just not enough data to say for certain that climate change played a role in the unusual heat and drought across parts of the U.S. this year, but it is likely that it had a hand in it. Scientists and computer models have consistently shown that as we continue to see an increase in greenhouse gases into the atmosphere the number of extreme heat waves will continue to grow. It has also been shown that severe drought will become more common in certain regions of the world. Compare the two NASA images below. The first one shows where the worst drought conditions were over the U.S. in July. The brown areas indicate where there is much less green vegetation compared to normal. Green areas indicate where there was more green vegetation compared to normal. The second image shows were the hottest temperatures compared to normal were located during the peak of the July heat wave. As you can see, the driest areas compared to normal are pretty much where the highest temperature anomalies are. With little or no moisture in the ground, the drought acts as a positive feedback to the heat since the sun's energy can go almost 100% directly to heating the ground instead of initially having to evaporate water from the ground (normal situation), which has a cooling effect. Also keep in mind, with less vegetation there is also a reduction in evaporation. ----------- Speaking of July......

Climate scientists use various proxies to determine how these forcings have changed over time. Some examples of climate forcings....... --changes in the energy output of the sun. --changes in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. --volcanic eruptions. --Aerosols.

When the sun is active, its magnetic field shields the Earth from cosmic rays. Low solar activity results in more cosmic rays reaching the planet. Cosmic rays striking the Earth. From NASA. As the particles crash through the Earth's atmosphere, they can ionize volatile compounds, causing them to condense into airborne droplets, or aerosols, according to the Nature News article. The question is whether or not clouds can build up around the airborne droplets, which in turn can have an influence on the global climate. I recently attended a climate science workshop, which was attended by several prominent climate scientists and they showed how there was no real link between changes in cosmic rays and global temperatures going way back in time. However, some have suggested that when high solar activity lowers levels of cosmic rays, that in turn reduces cloud cover and warms the planet. Sounds reasonable, but the data just does not support it. Researchers at CERN, Europe's high-energy physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland have recently done an experiment to see for themselves. Bombarding a chamber with protons from an accelerator, the researchers found that the cosmic rays do cause a change, but that those particles are far too small to serve as seeds for clouds. \"At the moment, it actually says nothing about a possible cosmic-ray effect on clouds and climate, but it's a very important first step,\" said Jasper Kirkby, a physicist at CERN.

Robert Kaufmann, a College of Arts & Sciences professor and chair of the department of geography & environment at Boston University, along with researchers from the University of Turku in Finland and from Harvard have determined that sulfur particles mostly emitted from coal burning power plants in Asia had reflected enough solar energy back to space to almost cancel out global warming for the period from 1998 to 2008. The team analyzed data that might influence the earth’s surface temperature collected between 1998 and 2008, including such things as greenhouse gas emissions, incoming radiation from the sun, sulfur pollution, and El Nino and La Nina warming and cooling patterns. The researchers plugged their data into a computer model, and found that it replicated the actual conditions: even while carbon dioxide increased, the surface temperature remained steady, according to BU Today. Today, China is now using scrubbers to reduce sulfur emissions which is good for the environment but will likely allow the globe to resume a fairly steady warming, according to the story. ----- Keep in mind that 1998 was an unusually warm year due to El Nino and so the period started off with an unusually high temperature anomaly.

The data subset consists of a network of individual land stations that has been designated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for use in climate monitoring and other data that the Met Office has finally gained permission from the owners to make available. This important announcement comes after a multi-year process of trying to get permissions from individual National Weather Services to allow the passing on of data to third parties, according to RealClimate's Gavin Schmidt. The Met Office also posted a FAQ section and I have posted some of the most likely FAQ's from their site...... 1. Are the data that you are providing the 'value-added' or the 'underlying' data? The station data that we are providing are from the database used to produce the global temperature series. Some of these data are the original underlying observations and some are observations adjusted to account for non climatic influences, for example changes in observations methods or site location. The database, therefore, consists of the 'value added' product that has been quality-controlled and adjusted to account for identified non-climatic influences. Adjustments were only applied to a subset of the stations, so in many cases the data provided are the underlying data minus any obviously erroneous values removed by quality control. The Met Office do not hold information as to adjustments that were applied and, so, cannot advise as to which stations are underlying data only and which contain adjustments. 2. How can you be sure that the global temperature record is accurate? The methods used have been peer-reviewed. There are three independent sets of global temperature that all clearly show the rise in global temperatures over the last 150 years. Furthermore, the strong scientific evidence that climate is changing as a result of human influence is also based on the growing evidence that other aspects of the climate system are changing. These include the atmosphere becoming more moist; global rainfall patterns changing; reductions in snow cover; glacier volume and Arctic sea-ice decreases; increases in sea-level. and changes in global scale circulation patterns. There are also numerous changes in phenological records which point towards a general warming and support the veracity of the instrumental record. 3. Why have you not previously shared the HadCRUT data? We have always provided the gridded HadCRUT product freely and without restriction for research use. The data set is available through the Met Office, University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) and has been used widely in research papers and the media. 4. Why can you not release all the data? When National Met. Services were contacted, many did not reply. A lack of a reply could not be considered to imply consent. Of the countries that did reply, only Poland stated that we could not release their data (aside from those data we released in December 2009 that were either in the Regional Basic Climatological Network (RBCN) or in the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Surface Network). Following the ruling of the Information Commissioner we have decided to release all station data, except those stations in Poland which we do not currently have permission to release. 5. Are there gaps in your data sets? By virtue that observations are not available from every location around the world, there will be places from which data are not received. HadCRUT does not infill any of these gaps in the data. 6. If some land stations are shown to be incorrect does this invalidate the whole data set? A single station or even a handful of stations that are incorrect will not materially impact the global estimates, although they will have impacts at the immediate regional level. Any issues or discrepancies arising from the data would be rectified as a matter of course, as soon as we are informed of them.

The models consistent with the new findings indicate that melting Greenland ice was responsible for a sea level rise of 1.6 to 2.2 meters – at most, roughly half of the minimum four-meter total increase. Even after accounting for other Arctic ice and the thermal expansion of warmer water, most of the difference must have come from a melting Antarctic ice sheet, Carlson says. \"The implication of our results is that West Antarctica likely was much smaller than it is today,\" and responsible for much more of the sea level rise than many scientists have thought, he says. \"If West Antarctica collapsed, that means it's more unstable than we expected, which is quite scary.\" The study was published in the July 29th issue of Science.

The problem is that these climate models base their estimation of carbon released from the soil on average projected temperatures. It is understood that warmer temperatures will speed up the rate of decomposition of stored organic matter in soils, a process that ordinarily is slow. This faster rate of decomposition, in turn, could further increase carbon released to the atmosphere and cause even greater global warming. The Earth's carbon cycle The combination of the variability of temperatures across different regions and complex biological processes make a big difference in the amount of carbon that is released from the soil, according to the report. Below are quotes from the Oregon State University News and Research Communications article..... “We’ve done a pretty good job of determining how much carbon is getting absorbed by growing trees and vegetation, how much is coming in,” said Mark Harmon, professor and holder of the Richardson Chair in Forest Science at OSU, and one of the world’s leading experts on the effect of decomposition on the Earth’s carbon cycle. “However, we know much less about how carbon is released to the atmosphere through the process of decomposition, how much is going out,” he said. “This is half of the equation, and there’s just a huge amount we don’t know about it.” In simple terms, less variability will equate to less soil carbon release. In the new analysis, considering the effects of variability, scientists found that temperature variability may be reduced in northern latitudes, in particular, and result in carbon releases that are lower than have been projected in one of the areas of the world where this phenomenon is of greatest concern, according to the OSU report. ---------- The study was just published in the journal Biogeosciences by scientists from the College of Forestry at Oregon State University and other institutions.

Some geologists use the argument that climate has changed naturally in the past, so how do we know current climate change is caused by humans? John Cook, the author of Climate Change Denial who also writes the blog Skeptical Science, wrote an solid article for Australia's ABC Environment about geologists and their views on the science of climate change. Here are some excerpts from Cook's ABC Environment piece. I suggest reading the whole article........ One survey of earth scientists found that while 97 per cent of actively publishing climate scientists agree humans are changing global temperatures, only 47 per cent of economic geologists (those who study geology with a view to its commerical exploitation) concur. In fact, among all earth scientists, economic geologists are the most sceptical. Skeptical Geologists...... ....the American Association of Petroleum Geologists \"respects these scientific opinions but wants to add that the current climate warming projections could fall within well-documented natural variations in past climate and observed temperature data\" However, the broader community of geologists seems convinced by the evidence that humans are causing global warming, according to Cook. The European Federation of Geologists says climate change is predominantly caused by anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and poses significant risks to human civilization. The Geological Society of America concurs that \"greenhouse gases have been an increasingly important contributor [to global warming] since the mid-1800s and the major factor since the mid-1900s\". The Geological Society of London states that \"evidence from the geological record is consistent with the physics that shows that adding large amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere warms the world and may lead to: higher sea levels and flooding of low-lying coasts; greatly changed patterns of rainfall; increased acidity of the oceans; and decreased oxygen levels in seawater\". Climate has changed in the past. Sometimes it changes quite dramatically. Why? When something causes a change in global temperature, such as varying solar activity or changes in the Earth's orbit, feedbacks amplify these changes. The atmosphere grows more humid and as water vapour is a greenhouse gas, this traps more heat. Arctic sea ice melts, causing the exposed ocean to absorb more heat. When geologists bring up past climate change, they're actually citing evidence for climate feedback. Dramatic swings in global temperature, dragging the planet in and out of ice ages, are possible because of these feedbacks. We (humans) have already given our climate a big nudge. How do we know it's us causing the warming and not natural causes? Because we've directly measured it. The feedbacks that amplified past climate change are now amplifying the warming caused by our carbon emissions. The case for human-caused warming is based on many independent lines of evidence. The peer-reviewed literature on past climate change sends a strong message, in stark contrast to what we hear from petroleum geologists. Past climate change is not a source of comfort.

By widespread convention, scientists use a minimum threshold of 95% to assess whether a trend is likely to be down to an underlying cause, rather than emerging by chance. If a trend meets the 95% threshold, it basically means that the odds of it being down to chance are less than one in 20. Last year's analysis, which went to 2009, did not reach this threshold; but adding data for 2010 takes it over the line. \"The trend over the period 1995-2009 was significant at the 90% level, but wasn't significant at the standard 95% level that people use,\" Professor Jones told BBC News. \"Basically what's changed is one more year [of data]. That period 1995-2009 was just 15 years - and because of the uncertainty in estimating trends over short periods, an extra year has made that trend significant at the 95% level which is the traditional threshold that statisticians have used for many years. ------ Note: Jones and other scientists were eventually cleared of any wrongdoing in regards to emails.

Most notable to U.S. residents has been recent onslaught of deadly tornado outbreaks and the massive Spring flooding. Is climate change to blame? Some experts say yes, others say no. I say maybe. This question, which has been popping up all over the media in recent months is not a new one, we covered this subject after Katrina and following a number of major snowstorms and heatwaves over the past decade. You cannot tie individual extreme weather events to climate change. There is just not enough data to support that right now. However, most credible studies do show that climate change will lead to an increase in the frequency of these extreme weather events across the globe. In this case we are specifically talking severe thunderstorms/deadly tornadoes, drought, heat waves, intense rainfall and catastrophic flooding. Research also indicates the climate change is likely increasing the strength of hurricanes, but not necessarily the total number. With better storm observation tools, even the smallest, most rural tornadoes are being detected now, which was not the case over 30 years ago. Expanding populations are also putting more and more people in harm's way. If we continue to see a steady, long-term trend increase in these horrible events over the coming years, which I believe will be the case even when you factor in the previous paragraph, then we may be able to go back and say that climate change was at least partly to blame. This Spring's extreme severe weather in the southern U.S. was predicted by AccuWeather.com... AccuWeather.com meteorologists knew by February of this year that the upcoming spring was going to be a wild one in terms of severe weather and flooding, and it was not because climate change was ongoing. The combination of a weakening La Nina and the anticipated sharp temperature anomaly gradient between the northern U.S. and the southern U.S. told us that the jet stream running across the U.S. would be abnormally strong this spring. A strong jet stream leads to more powerful storms and thunderstorms, which increases the chances of large tornadoes and widespread flooding. I am not downplaying climate change by any means. I personally know climate change is happening and that human actions are a main cause. There is little to debate about that.

However, snow and ice don’t have the same cooling power all year round. During winter, snow and ice dominate the Arctic landscape, but there is no sunlight to reflect. This means that the Arctic doesn’t do much to keep global temperatures cool during the winter. In summer, the Arctic is bathed in light constantly, but there isn’t as much snow and ice to reflect the light back into space, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

I mentioned last year that there was a decline in emissions during 2009 and most sources support the idea that this was due to the global financial downturn. The IEA’s 2010 World Energy Outlook set out the 450 ppm Scenario, an energy pathway consistent with achieving this goal, based on the emissions targets countries have agreed to reach by 2020. For this pathway to be achieved, global energy-related emissions in 2020 must not be greater than 32 Gt. This means that over the next ten years, emissions must rise less in total than they did between 2009 and 2010, according to the IEA news release.

This six year study using satellite data and computer modeling techniques was performed by Alex Gardner of the University of Michigan. The study is posted in the journal Nature.

Researchers examined three different regional climate models in terms of wind density changes in a future U.S. experiencing modest but noticeable climate change. \"Areas where the model predicts decreases in wind density are quite limited, and many of the areas where wind density is predicted to decrease are off limits for wind farms anyway,\" said Provost's Professor of Atmospheric Science Sara Pryor, the project's principal investigator. Image courtesy of Sara Pryor. Questions have lingered about whether a warmer atmosphere might lead to decreases in wind density or changes in wind patterns, according to EurekAlert. Comparing model predictions for 2041-2062 to past observations of wind density (1979-2000), most areas were predicted to see little or no change, according to the report. Wind farms are nearly carbon neutral, and studies show that a turbine pays for itself after only three months of energy production. A typical turbine lasts about 30 years, Pryor says, not because parts break, but because advances in technology make it desirable to replace turbines with newer versions, according to the EurekAlert article. Such predictions should prove crucial to American policymakers and energy producers, many of whom have pledged to make wind energy 20 percent of America's total energy production by 2030. Currently only about 2 percent of American energy comes from wind, according to the report.

The research group instead found that the \"Direct Air Capture\" or DAC method would be far more expensive than simply preventing the emission of carbon dioxide in the first place, according to the Princeton School of Engineering and Applied Science report.

The main issue is that methane, a chief component of natural gas and a potent greenhouse gas, is escaping into the atmosphere at far higher quantities from shale gas wells than previously thought. Natural gas has a much lower carbon dioxide emission when burned compared to coal and oil, thus it is considered more \"clean\". According to the New York Times, as much as 7.9 percent of methane gas is puffing out from shale gas wells, intentionally vented or flared, or seeping from loose pipe fittings along gas distribution lines. When all is factored together, Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology and his colleagues from Cornell conclude that the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas can be as much as 20 percent greater than, and perhaps twice as high as, coal per unit of energy, according to the NYT. Some are already questioning the validity of this research....... Mark D. Whitley, a senior vice president for engineering and technology with Range Resources, a gas drilling company with operations in several regions of the country, said the losses suggested by Mr. Howarth’s study were simply too high, according to the New York Times. “These are huge numbers,” he said. “That the industry would let what amounts to trillions of cubic feet of gas get away from us doesn’t make any sense. That’s not the business that we’re in.” (via the NYT) Also from the Harrisburg Patriot News..... In the very early stages of the well’s production, the first rush of gas is often set afire, or “flared,” until the fluids that flow up with it diminish. That early flowback period is when the study says a majority of the methane is vented to the atmosphere. But the study is based on wells that were not flared. Lead author Robert Howarth agreed if the wells are flared, the results of the study change. “It’s very difficult to figure out how often they do that rather than simply letting it vent,” he said. “The industry is resisting reporting it,” he said, and an attempt by the EPA to determine the frequency of flaring guessed between 15 and 50 percent of wells are probably flared.

The first of its kind research, led by Aaron McCright, an associate professor of Sociology, showed that the gap between Democrats and Republicans who believe global warming is happening increased 30 percent between 2001 and 2010. McCright used data from Gallup's annual environmental poll to show this growing gap. Back in 2001, 49% of republicans polled believed that the effects of global warming had already began. By 2010, that figure dropped to 29%. Back in 2001, 60% of democrats polled believed that the effects of global warming had already began. By 2010, that figure increased to 70%. When you compare conservatives and liberals, that same gap increased from 18% to 44%. Conservatives were much less likely to believe that the effects of global warming had begun compared to liberals. Interesting comments from the Michigan State News story... Among liberals and Democrats, having a college degree increases the likelihood of reporting beliefs consistent with the scientific consensus. Yet, among conservatives and Republicans, having a college degree often decreases the likelihood of reporting such beliefs.

In addition to the U.S., greenhouse gas emissions during the year 2009 also fell in Russia, Australia, Italy, Spain and France. The main reason for this decline was the recession, and more specifically a decline in energy consumption, especially in the U.S. U.S. greenhouse gas emissions dropped 6.1% in 2009, which was the biggest yearly change since the baseline record began in 1990.

When the general atmospheric circulation pattern does shift, the fresh, cold water is expected to enter the North Atlantic, with unpredictable impact on an ocean current system important to both European weather and marine food chain. Signs of such an atmospheric shift appeared in 2009 but the episode was too short to cause a major flush, according to project CLAMER. Arctic sea ice. Image courtesy of NASA.

Researchers from Purdue University and the University of California looked at the 170,000 year period of global warming during the end of the Palaeocene Eocene Thermal Maximum, which was 56 million years ago and has many features in common with the world's current situation. The team wanted to find out how the Earth system recovered and returned to normal atmospheric levels after this major warming. Image courtesy of NASA. The scientists examined samples of marine and terrestrial sediments deposited throughout the event. The team measured the levels of two different types of carbon atoms, the isotopes carbon-12 and carbon-13. The ratio of these isotopes changes as carbon dioxide is drawn from or added to the atmosphere during the growth or decay of organic matter, according to Eurekalert. What they found was that the Earth increased its ability to pull carbon from the air. This led to a recovery that was quicker than anticipated by many models of the carbon cycle, though still on the order of tens of thousands of years. \"We found that more than half of the added carbon dioxide was pulled from the atmosphere within 30,000 to 40,000 years, which is one-third of the time span previously thought,\" said Gabriel Bowen, the associate professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Purdue.

Studying ice core data is the most reliable and accurate way for paleoclimatologists to recreate past climates and past climate changes, according to The Daily Climate. Some of White's ice core research over the years has produced two striking facts, according to the Daily Climate article..... 1. The Earth's great ice ages are bookmarked by a clear fluctuation in carbon dioxide levels: 180 parts per million (ppm) in the glacial periods, 280 ppm in the warmer periods (the level at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution about 150 years ago). A shift of 100 ppm in CO2 concentrations meant the difference between flowers blooming in the Arctic and ice a mile deep over Chicago. 2. These global transformations happened fast. Warming trends that forced widespread ice melting and monumental sea-level rise weren't a millennium-long process. It was decadal. Today it is obvious to White that society doesn't understand the risks. As people keep adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, humanity could throw the Earth's climate out of whack in a geological hurry. Today global atmospheric CO2 concentrations stand at 392 ppm. White is clearly frustrated with the political climate that seems to be changing a lot slower than the planet's climate, and he's concerned that the Earth's future will likely look a lot more like its steamier past and a lot sooner than we might like, according to the The Daily Climate story. ------ Dr. James White.

The Hadley Data Set, which goes back to the 1950's contains sea ice condition information thanks to widespread shipping. This data set also shows that Arctic sea ice has declined since at least the mid 1950s. See image below. Going further back in time there are some problems with the shipping data.

By the way, the project's biggest private backer, at $150,000, is the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation. Oil billionaires Charles and David Koch are the nation's most prominent funders of efforts to prevent curbs on the burning of fossil fuels, the largest contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gases, according to the Los Angeles Times. But Muller unexpectedly told a congressional hearing last week that the work of the three principal groups that have analyzed the temperature trends underlying climate science is \"excellent.... We see a global warming trend that is very similar to that previously reported by the other groups,\" according to the Times article. The group was surprised by its findings, according to Muller, but he cautioned that the initial assessment is based on only 2% of the 1.6 billion measurements that will eventually be examined. (via the Times) Over the years, Muller has supported some ideas that weather station data in official studies are untrustworthy because of the urban heat island effect, which boosts temperature readings in areas that have been encroached on by cities and suburbs. But leading climatologists said the previous studies accounted for the effect, and the Berkeley analysis is confirming that, Muller acknowledged. \"Did such poor station quality exaggerate the estimates of global warming?\" he asked in his written testimony. \"We've studied this issue, and our preliminary answer is no.\" (from the LA Times) Other scientists noted that temperature is only one factor in climate change, according to the LA Times article. \"Even if the thermometer had never been invented, the evidence is there from deep ocean changes, from receding glaciers, from rising sea levels and receding sea ice and spring snow cover,\" said Peter Thorne, a leading expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. ---------- The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Project Paul Krugman wrote an interesting response to this story in an op-ed for the New York Times.

The research team used recent climate modeling to reach this conclusion. Carbon dioxide traps heat in the middle of the atmosphere.

Therefore, an increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 tends to suppress precipitation.

I read this interesting article from David Kroodsma of Climate Central. In the article, Kroodsma looks at snowstorm and snowfall trends in the Northeast U.S. over the past 30 years and tries to see if there is any link with climate change. A Northeast blizzard as seen from space. Here are some excerpts from the Climate Central article on what they found......... Is Climate Change Making Snowstorms Worse? The short answer is “maybe.” Average seasonal snowfall can come from many small storms or fewer, bigger ones. The past two winters have seen an abnormally high number of major storms — storms that drop more than 10 inches over large areas. Both 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 had three winter storms that qualified as at least a “Category 3” based on the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS). Even the 1995-96 winter didn’t have that many storms of this ranking, and you’d have to go back to 1960-61 to find as many high-scoring winter storms in a single season as we saw in each of the past two years. In the short run, climate change could actually mean more heavy snowstorms. A warmer atmosphere means that the air can hold more water vapor, and this can result in more storms with heavy precipitation. In fact, scientists have already documented an increase in heavy precipitation events. If it is cold enough to snow, these storms can drop heavy snow instead of rain. However, the possible links between climate change and heavy snowfall is an area of active scientific research, with no definitive answers yet. And many credit the past two years of heavy snow to the North Atlantic Oscillation, and not necessarily to climate change. Even if heavy snows increase over the next few decades, many climate scientists say that a warmer climate will eventually mean less total snowfall for the northeastern states, as more precipitation falls as rain. What do the climate models say? Climate models are relatively good at projecting temperature change, but they are less skilled at accurately projecting changes in precipitation. And predicting snowfall is especially tricky, as it requires getting both temperature and precipitation details right. As a result, our findings—that seasonal snowfall will decrease between 30 and 60 percent in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states by the end of the century—should be taken with a grain of salt.

Winters in northern Europe and over the Pacific Northwest are normally several degrees warmer on average compared to those in the Northeast U.S., eastern Canada and northeastern Asia. Conventional explanation for one of these differences in temperature has been the fact that the Gulf Stream, which is shown in orange off the U.S. East Coast below, delivers warm water from the Gulf of Mexico all the way to northern Europe, making that region noticeably warmer in the winter compared to the Northeast U.S. and eastern Canada. However, research from 2002 concluded that warm ocean currents can only contribute up to 10% of the warming. So what is the reason for the big difference in winter temperatures? According to researchers from CalTech, its the fact that the warm waters off the Northeast U.S., eastern Canada and northeast Asia coasts is actually causing these regions to run colder, which is the main reason for the temperature difference. The researchers found that the warm water off an eastern coast will heat the air above it and lead to the formation of atmospheric waves, drawing cold air from the northern polar region. The cold air forms a plume just to the west of the warm water. In the case of the Atlantic Ocean, this means the frigid air ends up right over the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, according to Eurekalert.

We're already seeing more insect attack, and we project that it will get worse.\" (from the Gazette Times article) \"For skeptics of climate change, it's worth noting that the increase in vulnerability of lodgepole pine we've seen in recent decades is made from comparisons with real climatic data, and is backed up with satellite-observations showing major changes on the ground,\" said Waring.

This also continues the slight month to month cooling trend that began in the fall of 2010, thanks mostly to the large scale cooling of the Pacific waters due to La Nina. As La Nina continues to slowly weaken through the spring and into the summer, I would expect the latest short-term downward trend to level-out, and then perhaps rise a bit, but we will see.

One thing that struck me was the dramatic drop in the Arctic region, which covers 60 N to 82.5 N. From last summer through the month of January, the average temperature anomaly in the arctic measured by RSS was close to +1.2 C. In February, the anomaly suddenly dropped to -0.110 C, which is the first time that this particular anomaly has dropped into the negative category since March of 2009. The most likely reason for this was the shift from a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation to the positive phase, which began in mid-January. Also, the RSS February temperature anomaly for February 2011 in the northern hemisphere came in at -0.012 C, which is only the third time since July of 2004 that this particular anomaly was below normal. Keep in mind, this recent cooling is just a blip on the large scale and not unexpected. The decadal temperature trend remains upward at 0.147 C per decade.

Could the rapid melting of glaciers due to climate change be a cause? The number and severity of earthquakes appears to have increased over the last 30 years in parallel to accelerating glacial melt. Some scientists think that glacier is lightening the load on the earth, allowing its mantle to rebound upwards, causing tectonic plates to become unstuck, according to the Montreal Gazette article. Location of major tectonic plates across the globe, courtesy of the USGS. In addition, the Montreal Gazette article provided the following in italics............ \"There is certainly some literature that talks about the increased occurrence of volcanic eruptions and the removing of load from the crust by deglaciation,\" said Martin Sharp, a glaciologist at the University of Alberta. \"It changes the stress load in the crust and maybe it opens up routes for lava to come to the surface.\" Sharp added that \"it is conceivable that there would be some increase in earthquake activity during periods of rapid changes on the Earth's crust.\" However, other scientists say those tectonic movements are too deep to be impacted by pressure releases from glacier melt. But what about the more dangerous shallower quakes? Andrew Hynes, a tectonics expert at McGill University, said the issue is not so much the load shift on the earth's crust, but rather the increased fluid pressure in the fault that lubricates the rock, allowing the plate to slide. \"All earthquakes except those produced by volcanic activity are essentially the unsticking of faults,\" he said. In other words, if you pump fluid into a fault, it will reduce the friction and the rock can slide. Could the stress transfers and the added melt from glaciers inject more fluid into the rocks creating earthquakes? \"It would only apply to earthquakes that are at shallow depths,\" he said. \"But I wouldn't push it any further than that.\" -------- You can read the entire story right here.

The researchers came to this conclusion based on analysis of sea floor sediments. They also found that the impacts of these rapid, intense warming events only had modest biological effect. Research also showed that these warm events, which on average lasted 40,000 years, stopped taking place around 40 million years ago and there have not been any since that time. In addition, the San Diego Union-Tribune article also has the following quotes......... \"I think this suggests that Earth is 'use to' dealing with abrupt and rapid climate change in which species move around but do not become extinct in masse. The difference from today is that we have massively restructured Earth's surface making it harder for species to move in the face of human-induced global change,\" said Scripps geologist Richard Norris, one of the study's co-authors. James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies at Columbia University, said by email to the Union-Tribune....... \"First, the events they refer to occurred on (a) 1000 year time scale. Yes, most species can migrate and adapt on that time scale. Human-made change will occur on the century time scale. Decadal-mean temperatures are now causing isotherms to move 50-60 km/decade toward the poles, and if we stay on business-as-usual CO2 growth that rate will increase. \"Second, humans are simultaneously putting other stresses on species and humans have taken over so much of the planet that it is hard for species to migrate to stay within the zones that they can survive in. \"So there is no way that they can draw such conclusions -- not with any validity,\" adds Hansen. Gavin Schmidt, a climate change researcher at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, said by email to the Union-Tribune........ \"But the uncertainties in today's climate are mostly related to aerosols, regional patterns, global warming impact on current ecosystems (most of which hadn't even evolved back in the Eocene), etc. So, while interesting from an intellectual standpoint, this new information is not going to change how 'scientists' think about climate change.\" --------- This study is published in the journal Nature, and you can also read the Scripps press release version right here.

A new study from the University of Michigan, and published in Nature Geoscience, indicates that a loss of snow and ice in the Northern Hemisphere has allowed the planet to warm more than climate models predicted it would. The scientific team used satellite data to measure how changes in snow and ice over the Northern Hemisphere have contributed to rising temperatures over the last 30 years. As the NASA Earth Observatory article states, bright snow and ice reflect more of the sun's energy back out to space, causing a cooling effect. When snow and ice melts, they give way to darker land or ocean, which absorbs more energy, resulting in a warming influence. The left image from NASA below shows how much energy the Northern Hemisphere’s snow and ice—called the cryosphere—reflected on average between 1979 and 2008. Dark blue indicates more reflected energy and thus more cooling. The right image above shows how the energy being reflected from the cryosphere has changed between 1979 and 2008. When snow and ice disappear, they are replaced by dark land or ocean, both of which absorb energy. The image shows that the Northern Hemisphere is absorbing more energy (red areas) , particularly along the outer edges of the Arctic Ocean. \"On average, the Northern Hemisphere now absorbs about 100 PetaWatts more solar energy because of changes in snow and ice cover,” says Mark Flanner of the University of Michigan. “To put it in perspective, 100 PetaWatts is seven-fold greater than all the energy humans use in a year.” Changes in the extent and timing of snow cover account for about half of the change, while melting sea ice accounts for the other half.

This is the first time that climate change was blamed for a single event by a scientific study, according to the story. The study concentrated on floods in 2000 that devastated parts of England and Wales, causing about $10 billion in damage.

Emanuel immediately countered, smiling and pointing at Shogren, \"No, YOU haven't.\" Kerry Emanuel According to a 2009 Pew Research Center poll, only 35% of Americans saw climate change as a serious problem. I will also add, that many Americans, at least right now, are much more concerned with jobs and getting food on the table. Trying to convince the public that global warming should be a major concern in their lives is a tough sell right now in this current economic state. Tom Rosensteil of the Project for Excellence in Journalism pointed the finger at the media, focusing on its overall contraction in the past two decades. Shrinking budgets have led to a proliferation of quick, cheap reporting, as well as discussion and commentary formats that rarely provide informative discussions of actual science results, according to the Scientific American article. Additional excerpts below from the Scientific American article........ \"It's quite clear there are many highly educated people who do not accept global warming,\" said Naomi Oreskes, a University of California, San Diego, science historian. Still, scientists \"must communicate climate science as clearly and effectively and robustly as we can,\" Most Americans in fact are ignorant of the facts of climate science and even \"confuse climate change with the ozone hole,\" said Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The processes around the latter's disappearance are related to global warming but \"how is that a basis for having any sensible conversation?\" he asked. Scientists must engage with the public and be vigilant against projecting stereotypes of their profession—such as the elitist, arrogant scientist, Schmidt said. Rosensteil echoed this advice and further urged scientists to bypass the media, who are no longer critical intermediaries for reaching the public given the growth of the blogosphere and the general fragmentation of the industry. He advised scientists similarly to make sure their points are very clear and to avoid giving climate deniers an opportunity to extract a phrase from ones communications or answers to questions that fits an anti-science theme. Emanuel offered the familiar explanation for why some scientists are allergic to public forums: \"There's an attitude in our culture that if we're doing outreach...we may be engaging in a kind of advocacy that is poisonous to science.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"41fc95df4dd6e9ffa0f0d13ce9d73a02fe4811cf"}

We found no evidence in the CRU emails to suggest that NOAA failed to adhere to its peer review procedures prior to its dissemination of information. Accusation: NOAA did not comply with federal laws pertaining to information/data sharing, namely the Federal Information Quality Act (IQA) the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and the Shelby Amendment. We found no evidence in the CRU emails to suggest that NOAA violated its obligations under the IQA. The investigation also targeted a total of 8 emails that they felt warranted further examination. In our own review of all 1,073 CRU emails, we found eight emails which, in our judgment, warranted further examination to clarify any possible issues involving the scientific integrity of particular NOAA scientists or NOAA's data. As a result, we conducted interviews with the relevant NOAA scientists regarding these eight emails, and have summarized their responses and explanations on pages 7-12 of the pdf. -------------- Speaking of climategate, which should probably be put to permanent rest now, I saw this article from George Mason University.

The result of this was an unusually long melt season on the icecap, which lasted 50 days longer than average in the south. The reason for the exceptional melt off was the fact that the unusual warmth in the spring of 2010 got the melt season off to a strong start. The melting persisted all the way into mid-September. You also combine this with the fact that there was little snow to replenish the losses, according to NASA. When the annual snow is melted away, parts of the ice cap are exposed. The surface of the ice is also darker than snow. Since dark ice was exposed earlier and longer in 2010, it absorbed more energy, leading to a longer melt season. A fresh coat of summer snow would have protected the ice sheet, but little snow fell, according to the NASA Earth Observatory article. Greatest melting compared to normal during 2010 was over the south and west of Greenland. Image courtesy of NASA. -------- Here is a short video from the scientific team showing the melting icecap.

The next attempt for launch is now March 4th. Glory was originally expected to be launched last year. The 424.1 million dollar spacecraft will study how radiation from the sun, along with aerosols, affect the Earth's atmosphere and climate. The satellite's onboard instruments will also collect data to enhance scientific models, and could help paint a clearer picture of the causes and consequences of climate change, according to the Space.com article. The glory satellite before encapsulation. Image courtesy of NASA. Glory getting prepared for launch last week. NASA also provided some brief FAQ's on the mission............ What is the reason for this mission? To get an accurate description of Earth's energy budget — the amount of energy entering and exiting the Earth's climate system — is important for anticipating future changes to the climate. Shifts in the global climate and associated weather patterns impact human life by altering landscapes and changing the availability of natural resources. NASA is working to improve the understanding of exactly how and why this energy budget changes, and the Glory mission will play a key role. Is the sun the cause of the global warming observed during the last century? No. Scientists who study the links between solar activity and climate believe that the small variations in the sun's irradiance cannot explain the intensity and speed of warming trends seen on Earth during the last century. The 0.1 percent shift in solar irradiance simply isn't enough to have a strong influence, and there's no convincing evidence that suggests the solar energy striking the top of the atmosphere has trended upward enough over the last century to affect climate significantly. How do aerosols affect the climate? Aerosols can affect climate directly by scattering and absorbing incoming sunlight — or radiation reflected by the surface of Earth — as it passes through the atmosphere. The bulk of aerosols, particularly sulfates, scatter incoming sunlight, some of it back toward space, thus cooling Earth's surface immediately below. Other aerosols, especially black carbon, can absorb some of the incoming radiation and warm the atmosphere.

The team found that even in the warm Cretaceous period, the patterns of these climatic oscillations changed over longer decadal timescales. \"A key question is how an Arctic without permanent ice cover will affect atmospheric circulation and climate variability, particularly over high and mid latitudes,\" said Professor Alan Kemp of the University of Southampton’s School of Ocean and Earth Science. One way of addressing this issue is to look back at previous greenhouse episodes in Earth’s history through sediment cores from the Arctic Ocean, according to the report. \"Understanding Late Cretaceous climate should inform debate about future climate trends and variability under greenhouse conditions,\" said Kemp, whose team’s new findings are published in Geophysical Research Letters. (via the National Oceanography Centre report) Their analyses revealed that the Arctic climate of the Late Cretaceous varied over various timescales with periodicities closely matching those observed in the modern Arctic. It therefore appears that the Arctic was subject to some of the same climatic influences in the Late Cretaceous as it is today, including ENSO, which periodically transmits equatorial influences to high-latitudes via ocean-atmosphere interactions. (from the NOC report) \"A modern Arctic lacking permanent sea ice should be subject to similar influences as it was under greenhouse conditions in the Late Cretaceous,\" said Kemp. \"Based on our findings, it seems unlikely that man-made global warming would cause a permanent El Nino state,” concluded Kemp.

Sea ice volume takes into account both sea ice thickness and extent, which makes it the most important factor in measuring the overall health of sea ice. Arctic Sea Ice Volume is an important indicator of climate change because it accounts for variations in sea ice thickness as well as sea ice extent. Total Arctic sea ice volume cannot currently be observed continuously. Observations from satellites, Navy submarines, moorings, and field measurements are limited in space or time. The assimilation of observations into numerical models, currently provides one way of estimating sea ice volume changes on a continuing basis. (from the UW's PolarScience Center. ) As you can see by the University of Washington PIOMAS graph below, Arctic sea ice volume has been on a steady decline since the late 1970s. Now it is about 70% lower than the mean. The bottom image below shows the changes in Arctic sea ice since 1981. You can see that thinner, less than 1 year old ice has increased, while thicker, multi-year ice has decreased. Image courtesy of the NSIDC. Not convinced? Let's hear from the experts...... Some of you may still think that the Arctic sea ice is recovering. You state that in 2008, Arctic sea ice reached a minimum extent that was about 10 percent greater than the record low of 2007, and the minimum extent in 2009 was greater than either 2007 or 2008. The data suggest that the ice reached a record low volume in 2008, and has thinned even more in 2009. Sea ice extent normally varies from year to year, much like the weather changes from day to day. But just as one warm day in October does not negate a cooling trend toward winter, a slight annual gain in sea ice extent over a record low does not negate the long-term decline , according to the NSIDC. So, what would scientists call a recovery in sea ice? First, a true recovery would continue over a longer time period than two years. Second, scientists would expect to see a series of minimum sea ice extents that not only exceed the previous year, but also return to within the range of natural variation. In a recovery, scientists would also expect to see a return to an Arctic sea ice cover dominated by thicker, multi-year ice, according to the NSIDC FAQ section . The image below shows the changes in ice thickness between March 1988 and 2010. Image courtesy of the NSIDC. Note how much the thicker, multi-year ice has decreased. First-year ice is usually much thinner and more susceptible to complete melting during the summer months. In November of 2010, Rear Admiral Titley, a U.S. Navy oceanographer testified that there will be 4 weeks of ice free conditions in the Arctic during the summer months by the mid to late 2030's. To sum up, I personally find no evidence that Arctic sea ice is recovering in terms of both extent and thickness. ------ Many thanks to the National Snow and Ice Data Center and the University of Washington for their excellent graphics and data.

Moderate to strong La Nina conditions have dominated across the equatorial Pacific Ocean since the second half of 2010 and we have been approaching perhaps one of the strongest La Nina events in 50 years, but there are indications that La Nina has peaked. Below is the latest look at sea surface temperature anomalies across the globe. The large darker blue area over the equatorial Pacific shows the expanse of colder than normal sea surface waters, which is indicative of a strong La Nina. La Nina is the unusual cooling of the sea surface waters along the equatorial Pacific, which is the opposite of El Nino. La Nina's and El Nino's typical form during the April-June period and peak in intensity during the December-February period. They usually last 9-12 months, but can go as long as 2 years. We usually see a La Nina every 2 to 7 years, according to the International Research institute for Climate and Society. So far, this current La Nina is a strong one, with sea surface temperatures along the equatorial Pacific averaging 1.7 degrees celsius below normal. There is no doubt that this La Nina is having major impacts on the weather patterns across large portions of the globe. The most obvious is the overall cooling influence, which was NOT unexpected by most climate scientists. Has this La Nina peaked in intensity? There are some indications that is has, but we may not truly know for another month or two. According to the NOAA image below, sea surface temperatures have rebounded a little bit across the central and eastern equatorial Pacific over the last 30 days. If this trend continues for another month then I think we can say that this latest La Nina has truly peaked. The latest computer model ensemble forecast below, courtesy of IRI, still forecasts La Nina to peak by the end of this winter with a gradual weakening trend into the summer. Neutral conditions are within .5 of zero, with La Nina at -.5 or less and El Nino at +.5 or more for consecutive months. Whether or not this La Nina has actually peaked,its influence will continue well into 2011. According to IRI, easterlies remain much stronger than normal and subsurface heat content remains well below normal, which likely means we will be dealing with at least moderate La Nina conditions for another 2 to 4 months minimum. The image below from IRI shows how this current La Nina is measuring up against other previous strong La Ninas. The plot is of equatorial pacific SST anomalies going back 1.5 years.

The research team, led by professor Andrew Shepard, used satellite imagery to track the progress of the west Greenland ice sheet as it slipped towards the sea each summer, over five years, according to the Guardian. A new moulin hole opening up on the Greenland ice sheet. Image from NASA. Key points from the Guardian article......... Researchers had feared that more melting from the surface of the ice in hotter years would in turn provide more meltwater for a slippery film at the sheet's base. More melting would mean more slippage and a greater rise in the sea level. But they discovered that, above a certain threshold, the slipping began to slow. On-the-ground studies and work done on alpine glaciers suggest that higher volumes of meltwater form distinct channels under the ice, draining the water more efficiently and reducing the formation of a lubricating film. A steep cliff on the Greenland ice cap. If the entire ice sheet melted, global sea levels would rise by a whopping 7 meters, but it would likely take at least 3,000 years if the only factor is by warmer air blowing over the ice.

I found a some good FAQ's from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center below. Currently, according to the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide as of December 2010 was at 389.69 ppm and continues to steadily rise. Here is a time history of atmospheric CO2, video courtesy of YouTube. ------------- What is the greenhouse effect? A: The greenhouse effect concerns the warming of the lower part of the atmosphere by increasing concentrations of the so-called greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and others) in the troposphere. This warming occurs because the greenhouse gases, while they are transparent to incoming solar radiation, absorb infrared (heat) radiation from the Earth that would otherwise escape from the atmosphere into space; the greenhouse gases then re-radiate some of this heat back towards the surface of the Earth. (courtesy Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center) In terms of mass, how much carbon does 1 part per million by volume of atmospheric CO2 represent? A: 1 ppmv of CO2= 2.13 Gt of carbon. (courtesy Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center) What percentage of the CO2 in the atmosphere has been produced by human beings through the burning of fossil fuels? A: About 14%. (courtesy Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center) Why do certain compounds, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and emit infrared energy? A: Certain wavelengths of infrared radiation moving upward from the earth are absorbed by molecules consisting of 3 or more atoms, such as carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. The absorbed energy causes these molecules to go into excited modes of vibration until they get rid of the absorbed energy. One way to get rid of the energy is to emit infrared radiation, some of which will be radiated back down towards the earth. (courtesy Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center) Is there any ONE person who discovered global warming? If not, what year was global warming discovered?. A: The first person to have quantitatively predicted a change in surface temperature resulting from increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide is generally acknowledged as Svante Arrhenius, in 1896.

This continues the short downward trend of temperature anomalies that began in the fall of 2010 in response to the strengthening La Nina. This is not unexpected to climate scientists. La Nina's have a general cooling influence on the global temperature. Future long-term warming forecasts take into account the fluctuations of La Nina and El Nino.

During the Fall 2007 to spring 2008 La Nina, which was similar in strength to this current La Nina, global satellite measured temperatures during 4 of the first 6 months of 2008 were actually below normal.

Developing a new method to remove the bias, which has hurt the accuracy, Hiroki Tokinaga and Shang-Ping Xie have come up with corrected observations. The corrected data now show that the trade-winds in the tropical Atlantic have actually weakened. They also show that the pattern of ocean temperature has changed. The raw observations of winds over the ocean suggest that the winds have grown stronger during the last 60 years. The trend is, however, largely due to a change in the placement of the anemometers, the instruments measuring wind speed. Ships are the main source of wind data over the ocean, and ships have increased in height and so has the anemometer placement. Tokinaga and Xie corrected this wind bias using wind-wave heights. The tropical Atlantic has three major ship routes along which ships provide meteorological data. Applying their new correction technique to observations along these routes from 1950 to 2009 together with other observations, they found the trade winds in the tropical Atlantic had weakened significantly during this period, according to the EurekAlert release. This graphic shows changes over the last 60 years in the August marine-cloudiness and land-rainfall over the tropical Atlantic. Yellow to dark red indicates more cloudiness/rainfall; light blue to gray, less cloudiness/rainfall. Image courtesy Hiroki Tokinaga, IPRC/SOEST/UHM. Trade-wind changes were caused by the asymmetric reduction in surface solar radiation due to man-produced aerosols, the reduction affecting the northern more than the southern hemisphere. Due to these changes, the cold tongue of water that stretches out from the eastern tropical Atlantic coast has warmed more than the western part of the basin. At the same time, the weakened trade winds have resulted in less upwelling of cold water and nutrients in the eastern tropical Atlantic, according to EurekAlert. There has also been a very significant increase in rainfall over the ocean and adjacent land areas such as the equatorial coastal regions of the Amazon and the Guinea Coast. If aerosol emissions decrease over the next decades, the tropical Atlantic climate may experience yet another shift as greenhouse gas forcing increases. Such a shift in the patterns of climate change (i.e., precipitation and sea level) will have important impacts on the socio-economics of regions surrounding the tropical Atlantic, according to the report. ------- This study was recently published in Nature Geoscience.

Normally frozen over by late November, these areas did not completely freeze until mid-January 2011. The Labrador Sea was also unusually ice-free. What were the possible reasons for this record low extent? According to the NSIDC, a persistent negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation during December and January allowed wind patterns to bring unusually warm air into northeastern Canada and the Arctic, while the eastern U.S. and parts of Europe were in the deep freeze with numerous snowstorms. The Arctic Oscillation went back into the positive phase at the end of January and remains positive as of this writing.

As more ground and open water are exposed to sunlight, more solar heat is absorbed, increasing the rate of snow and ice melting nearby, according to the University of Michigan study, which looked at satellite data between 1979 and 2008. It is now estimated that ice and snow in the northern hemisphere is now reflecting on average 3.3 watts sq/m of solar energy back into space.

Here are the results... According to the RSS data , the average global temperature was .251 C or .452 F above normal. This makes December 2010 the 7th warmest December in the RSS satellite record going back to 1979. The RSS map below shows the global temperature anomalies for the lower troposphere during December 2010. Note the cooling over a large part of the Pacific and over the Southeast U.S., while much of NE Canada remained unusually warm due to a persistent high pressure blocking pattern. The United States as a whole was colder than normal for the month with a temperature anomaly of -.908 C or -1.63 F. December 2009, however was still much colder with an anomaly of -1.9 C or -3.42 F. The impact of the strong La Nina (unusual cooling of the surface waters of the equatorial Pacific) was evident in the low latitudes (20 S to 20 N) with a lower tropospheric temperature anomaly of -.228 C or -.41 F. On the flip side, the Arctic region (60N to 82.5N) continues to experience unusual warmth. The temperature anomaly for December 2010 was +1.456 C or +2.62 F. The longer term trend since 1979 is still at +.163 C per decade, according to RSS. The last three months of 2010 were the coolest relative to the normals globally, which is also likely a reflection of the overall cooling of the large Pacific Ocean surface waters.

Leading climate economist William Nordhaus, who is a Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale University, states that carbon taxes are the best way to achieve significant reductions in greenhouse emissions. Nordhaus makes his case in the January 6th edition of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Nordhaus argues that the cap-and-trade approach used in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol will not accomplish the goals of slowing climate change. As currently designed, it is both economically inefficient and ineffective and should be supplemented or replaced. Additionally, a carbon tax could be a useful means to cut budget deficits while meeting environmental objectives, according to EurekAlert. William Nordhaus says it is necessary to raise the price of carbon to implement carbon policies so that they will have an impact on everyday human decisions, and on decision makers at every level in every nation and sector. Given a choice between a cap-and-trade system (such as is embodied in the Kyoto model), and a carbon tax system (such as is used for limiting gasoline or cigarette consumption), Nordhaus favours taxation: \"Countries have used taxes for centuries,\" he says. \"By contrast, there is no experience - as in zero - with international cap-and-trade systems.\" (via EurekAlert) The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"c6f3e1196736d6c744393ad5da41c6a2c4dab320"}

According to NASA, the record temperature in 2010 is particularly noteworthy, because the last half of the year was marked by a transition to strong La Nina conditions, which bring cool sea surface temperatures to the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies found that the average global land/sea combined temperature for 2010 was 0.63 C or 1.13 F above the 1951-1980 average, which puts 2010 in a statistical tie with 2005, which came in at +0.62 or +1.12 F.

The loss of sea ice may also be driving Arctic air into the middle latitudes. Winter weather patterns are notoriously chaotic, and the GISS analysis finds seven of the last 10 European winters warmer than the average from 1951 to 1980. The unusual cold in the past two winters has caused scientists to begin to speculate about a potential connection to sea ice changes. \"One possibility is that the heat source due to open water in Hudson Bay affected Arctic wind patterns, with a seesaw pattern that has Arctic air downstream pouring into Europe,\" Hansen said. ------- NOAA also agrees that 2010 was the warmest on record along with 2005.

The low ice conditions in December occurred in conjunction with above-average air temperatures in regions where ice would normally expand at this time of year, according to the NSIDC. The warm temperatures in December came from two sources: unfrozen areas of the ocean continued to release heat to the atmosphere, and an unusual circulation pattern brought warm air into the Arctic from the south. Although the air temperatures were still below freezing on average, the additional ocean and atmospheric heat slowed ice growth.

If the current pace of emitting greenhouse gases continues through the end of this century, future temperatures may eventually rise far more than currently projected, according to a new study from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, which looked at the earth's climate tens of millions of years ago. The study also indicates that the planet’s climate system, over long periods of times, may be at least twice as sensitive to carbon dioxide than currently projected by computer models, which have generally focused on shorter-term warming trends, according to the UCAR News Center release. The study also found that carbon dioxide may have at least twice the effect on global temperatures than currently projected by computer models of global climate, according to the report. The author of the study, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) scientist Jeffrey Kiehl , focused on a fundamental question..... When was the last time Earth’s atmosphere contained as much carbon dioxide as it may by the end of this century? Kiehl specializes in studying global climate in Earth’s geologic past. Video courtesy of YouTube. If society continues on its current pace of increasing the burning of fossil fuels, atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide are expected to reach about 900 to 1,000 parts per million by the end of this century. That compares with current levels of about 390 parts per million, and pre-industrial levels of about 280 parts per million. (from the UCAR News Center) By analyzing molecular structures in fossilized organic materials, Kiehl showed that carbon dioxide levels likely reached 900 to 1,000 parts per million about 35 million years ago. At that time, temperatures worldwide were substantially warmer than at present, especially in polar regions—even though the Sun’s energy output was slightly weaker. The high levels of carbon dioxide in the ancient atmosphere kept the tropics at about 9-18 degrees F (5-10 degrees C) above present-day temperatures. The polar regions were some 27-36 degrees F (15-20 degrees C) above present-day temperatures. (from the UCAR News Center) Because carbon dioxide is being pumped into the atmosphere at a rate that has never been experienced, Kiehl could not estimate how long it would take for the planet to fully heat up. However, a rapid warm-up would make it especially difficult for societies and ecosystems to adapt, he says.

I linked to UAH's Dr. Roy Spencer in this blog earlier in the week about the record tying satellite measured temperatures for 2010. In his report he also discussed the upcoming changes in the normals. A typical climate normal is based on the weather pattern over a 30-year period. The old normals were based on data from 1971-2000, according to the NYT article. The new normals, which will be released later this year, will drop the cooler 1970's and add the 2000's, which is the warmest recorded decade in history, according to the NYT. Based on the above, you can bet that the new normals are going to be a bit higher over a majority of regions across the world. The greatest increase in normals will likely be over the northern high latitudes, while the southern latitudes will see the least amount of change in their normal temperatures. The New York Times also makes a good point............ .....with shortened normals comes a risk of underplaying recorded changes to the climate. Even the updated 30-year normals will mask some of the temperature changes of recent history. \"When people switch over to the 1981-2010 standards, the effects on climate change aren't going to be as pronounced,\" said Anthony Arguez, NCDC's climate normals project manager. So, over the next ten years the decadal trend of temperature anomalies will not be as high as it would have been if they kept the 1971-2000 mean. We have to always keep that in mind.

The urban heat island effect causes cities to run warmer than surrounding rural areas, especially at night. Development produces heat islands by replacing vegetation, particularly forests, with pavement and other urban infrastructure. This limits plant transpiration, an evaporative process that helps cool plant leaves and also cools air temperatures, explained Robert Wolfe of Goddard, one of the scientists who developed the method. Dark city infrastructure, such as black roofs, also makes urban areas more apt to absorb and retain heat. Heat generated by motor vehicles, factories, and homes also contributes to the development of urban heat islands, according to the NASA news release. How much warmer on average do cities in the Northeast run in the summer compared to rural areas? The answer is between 7 and 9 degrees celsius or 13 to 16 degrees F. The NASA GISS team wanted to go further, and find out why the magnitude of heat islands can vary significantly between cities. The research team is using satellite technology to get that answer. Here is what they found (via the NASA story)......... 1. The largest cities usually have the strongest heat islands. Cities located in forested regions, such as the northeastern United States, also have stronger heat islands than cities situated in grassy or desert environments. 2. Densely-developed cities with compact urban cores such as Providence, RI are more apt to produce strong urban heat islands than more sprawling, less intensely-developed cities such as Buffalo, NY. 3. Cities in desert regions, such as Las Vegas, in contrast, often have weak heat islands or are actually cooler than the surrounding rural area. The heat island of Providence, Rhode Island (where I grew up by the way) as shown from space below. Brighter colors indicate warmer temperatures. Solutions to the the heat island effect? Making sure cities have trees and parks interspersed throughout the compact urban cores can help defend against heat islands. And studies shows that painting the surfaces of roads and buildings white instead of black and creating \"green\" roofs that include vegetation can soften urban heat islands, according to the story.

To see all the decades, just click the link I posted above. The average global temperature on earth has increased by 0.8 C or 1.4 F since 1880. Two-thirds of that warming took place after 1975, according to NASA. According to NASA, a one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins, according to the story. The leveling off between the 1940s and 1970s may be explained by natural variability and possibly by cooling effects of aerosols generated by the rapid economic growth after World War II, according to NASA. -------- GISS uses publicly available data from 6,300 meteorological stations around the world; ship-based and satellite observations of sea surface temperature; and Antarctic research station measurements.

This is the first time such a measurement has been made from observations, according to Physorg.com. The uncertainty about the feedback clouds will exhibit to increased greenhouse gases and a warmer climate remains one of the most difficult problems in long-term climate prediction, according to the article. Andrew Dessler, lead author of the study found evidence of a positive feedback, and evidence that despite the uncertainty levels, current climate models are doing a reasonable job simulating cloud feedback. Low clouds Low altitude clouds composed of water droplets (i.e., not ice) typically reflect solar radiation and cool the atmosphere, while high altitude, icy, cirrus clouds typically trap outgoing infrared radiation and creating additional warming. Dessler found about an 80 percent likelihood that from 2000 to 2010 the global cloud cover created a positive feedback -- which means that on the whole clouds created an additional warming effect on the planet, according to Physorg.com.

In the summary , which was led by Dr. James Hansen, a number of important points are made...... 1. Contrary to a popular misconception, the rate of warming has not declined, according to NASA. 2. Record high global 12-month running-mean temperature for the period with instrumental data was reached in 2010. The new record temperature in 2010 is particularly meaningful because it occurs when the recent minimum of solar irradiance is having its maximum cooling effect. 3. Satellite-observed nightlights are used to identify measurement stations located in extreme darkness and adjust temperature trends of urban and peri-urban stations for non-climatic factors, verifying that urban effects on analyzed global change are small. 4. Communication of the status of global warming to the public has always been hampered by weather variability. Lay people's perception tends to be strongly influenced by the latest local fluctuation. 5. Other obstacles to public communication include the media's difficulty in framing longterm problems as 'news', a preference for sensationalism, a generally low level of familiarity with basic science, and a preference for 'balance' in every story. 6. Polls indicate that the attacks on scientists have been effective in causing many members of the public to doubt the reality or seriousness of global warming. 7. Temperature data are too useful for scientific studies to be kept under wraps, so NASA GISS will continue to make the data available on a monthly basis. However, there is a practical disadvantage to this in that it allows any data flaws to be interpreted and misrepresented as machinations. 8. Main task is to describe ongoing global temperature change with as much clarity and insight as NASA GISS can. ------- Note: NASA GISS comments here about communication of this climate change science to the public are their opinion.

Instead, future rises of 3 or 4 celsius are much more likely. Scientists from the University of Exeter and the Met Office warned that if high levels of emissions continued, temperature rises of 4C would be reached in the 2070s, but with strong \"feedbacks\" - for example reductions in the ability of warmer oceans to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, amplifying the warming - temperatures could rise by 4C by the 2060s, according to the Telegraph (UK).

In the study, which was just published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the research team identified conditions under which coastal wetlands could survive rising sea level. Using a rapid sea-level rise scenario, most coastal wetlands worldwide will disappear near the end of the 21st century. In contrast, under the slow sea-level rise projection, wetlands with low sediment availability and low tidal ranges are vulnerable and may drown. However, in the slow sea-level rise projection, wetlands with higher sediment availability would be more likely to survive, according to the USGS Newsroom release. \"Previous assessments of coastal wetland responses to sea-level rise have been constrained because they did not consider the ability of wetlands to naturally modify their physical environment for adaptation,\" said USGS scientist Matt Kirwan, an author of this report. \"Failure to incorporate the interactions of inundation, vegetation and sedimentation in wetlands limits the usefulness of past assessments.\"(from the USGS Newsroom).

The U.S. National Ice Center declared both the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route open for a period during the month of September 2010. This is the 4th year in a row and the 4th time in recorded history the the Northwest Passage has opened for navigation.

From what I have read, a total of 18 ships traveled through this passage and cleared customs this year in Inuvik, Canada. In 2009, that number was 7. A pair of Finnish sailors who completed a voyage through the Northwest Passage during September noted that the Canadian part of the passage was largely free of pack ice and wildlife, according to the Vancouver Sun article. \"There's almost nothing there,\" says Riitta Kauppila. \"There was ice and snow in places, but mostly the sea was open, and the land was brown, desolate and empty.\" The Finnish sailors were one of five private sailboats to traverse the passage this year. The couple says the Arctic still had ice this summer; even in their steel-hulled vessel, they faced the frequent worry of running into ice floes and bergs that could damage or trap their boat.

The Los Angeles Times recently ran a story about the potential impacts of a GOP controlled House of Representatives on climate scientists and the Environmental Protection Agency. Here are some excerpts from the story....... --GOP leadership will try to portray the EPA as abusing its authority and damaging the economy with needless regulation, since the Obama Administration is trying to use the EPA's authority over air pollution to tighten emissions controls on coal, oil and other carbon fuels that scientists say contribute to global warming. --GOP leadership will focus on what they see as distortions of scientific evidence in regards to climate change with wide-ranging and sustained investigations. --Plan to investigate climate scientists they contend manipulated data to prove the case that human activity is contributing to global warming. According to the LA Times, EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson conceded that a Republican anti-regulatory campaign could end up effectively hamstringing her agency's work. The new rules EPA has issued over the last year on vehicle emissions and those expected soon for industry, Jackson said, \"would be endangered by many, if not all, of the efforts we've seen to take away the agency's greenhouse gas authority.\" .....the Obama White House has also embraced the broad consensus within the scientific community that human activity, mainly through the emitting of carbon dioxide, has led to global warming. .....the Republican Party has hammered at the administration's environmental agenda during the campaign. And rejecting the work of climate scientists has become increasingly common among conservatives. Several key Republican Congressmen -- most notably Rep. Darrell Issa (R), who could take over the chairmanship of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee -- have said they plan to investigate climate scientists they contend manipulated data to prove the case that human activity is contributing to global warming. Issa specifically wants to target the so-called \"climategate\" scandal. Several independent panels abroad and in the U.S. that reviewed the emails cleared the scientists of wrongdoing and found their research to be reliable.

In this case, that threshold is close to 27 degrees celsius or 80 degrees F. Researchers at the International Pacific Research Center (IPRC) of the University of Hawaii at Manoa wanted to see how rising ocean temperatures associated with global warming would affect this threshold. If the threshold does not rise, it could mean more frequent hurricanes, but obviously the results of this study do show a slight rise in the threshold. Using satellite estimates of tropical ocean rainfall over the past 30 years, the research team determined that changes in the threshold temperature for convection closely follow the changes in average tropical sea surface temperature, which have both been rising approximately 0.1°C (.2 F) per decade. The image below shows how the observed (black) tropical SST and the estimated threshold SST temperature for convection rose together over the past 30 years.

The study notes further that global climate models project that the sea surface temperature threshold for convection will continue to rise in tandem with the tropical average sea surface temperature. If true, hurricanes and other forms of tropical convection will require warmer ocean surfaces for initiation over the next century, according to the University of Hawaii at Manoa news report. ------ This paper appears in the Advance Online Publications of Nature Geoscience.

The findings are published in the journal Science. The authors of the study focused on one of the hottest episodes of Earth's climate history - the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO), which occurred around 40 million years ago. According to the EurekAlert article, Ancient climates can be reconstructed by analysing the carbon isotope ratios of molecules preserved in fossilised algae. The team used fossilised algae preserved in sediment cores extracted from the seafloor near Tasmania, Australia, by the Ocean Drilling Program. They refined their estimates of carbon dioxide levels using information on the past marine ecosystem derived from studying changes in the abundance of different groups of fossil plankton, according to EurekAlert. Their analyses indicate that MECO carbon dioxide levels must have at least doubled over a period of around 400,000 years. In conjunction with these findings, analyses using two independent molecular proxies for sea surface temperature show that the climate warmed by between 4 and 6 degrees Celsius over the same period. (from EurekAlert). The researchers consider it likely that elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels during the MECO resulted in increased global temperatures, rather than vice versa, arguing that the increase in carbon dioxide played the lead role. \"The change in carbon dioxide 40 million years ago was too large to have been the result of temperature change and associated feedbacks,\" said co-lead author Peter Bijl of Utrecht University. \"Such a large change in carbon dioxide certainly provides a plausible explanation for the changes in Earth's temperature.\" (from EurekAlert). The scientists have yet to determine an exact cause for the change in CO2, but the rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels around 40 million years ago approximately coincides with the rise of the Himalayas and may be related to the disappearance of an ocean between India and Asia as a result of plate tectonics – the large scale movements of the Earth's rocky shell. ---------- The study was led by scientists at Utrecht University, working with colleagues at the NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and the University of Southampton.

Climate contrarians also argue that water vapor is clearly the most important greenhouse gas. Back in November 2009, Scientific American ran an article which listed an easy to understand rebuttal of the above claims. Back in 1859, Physicist John Tyndall showed that even at that low concentration of 0.04%, CO2 absorbs infrared radiation and acts as a greenhouse gas. Many years later in 1896, chemist Svante Arrhenius calculated (without computer help of course) that doubling the CO2 concentration might cause almost 6 degrees celsius of warming, which is not too far off of much more recent computations. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, anthropogenic (man-made) CO2 amounts to about 30 billion tons annually, which is more than 130 times as much as volcanoes produce. Indeed, 95 percent of the releases of CO2 to the atmosphere are natural, but natural processes such as plant growth and absorption into the oceans pull the gas back out of the atmosphere and almost precisely offset them, leaving the human additions as a net surplus, according to the Scientific American article. Also from the SA article in regards to water vapor......... Contrarians frequently object that water vapor, not CO2, is the most abundant and powerful greenhouse gas; they insist that climate scientists routinely leave it out of their models. The latter is simply untrue: from Arrhenius on, climatologists have incorporated water vapor into their models. In fact, water vapor is why rising CO2 has such a big effect on climate. CO2 absorbs some wavelengths of infrared that water does not so it independently adds heat to the atmosphere. As the temperature rises, more water vapor enters the atmosphere and multiplies CO2's greenhouse effect. Water vapor enters and leaves the atmosphere much more quickly than CO2, and tends to preserve a fairly constant level of relative humidity, which caps off its greenhouse effect, according to NASA's Gavin Schmidt. Climatologists therefore categorize water vapor as a feedback rather than a forcing factor.

By analyzing six decades of U.S. and European weather and climate data, the team found that the center of the \"Bermuda High\" intensified by 0.9 geopotential meters a decade on average from 1948 to 2007, according to the EurekAlert report. As the \"Bermuda High\" intensified, its area grew, bringing the high's western ridge closer to the U.S. by 1.22 degrees longitude per decade. The team ruled out possible natural causes such as the AMO, ENSO and PDO as causes for this change. \"Our analysis strongly suggests that the changes in the NASH are mainly due to anthropogenic warming,\" said lead author Wenhong Li, assistant professor of earth and ocean sciences at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment.

Without non-condensing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and chlorofluorocarbons, water vapor and clouds would unable to provide the feedback mechanisms that amplify the greenhouse effect, according to the NASA story. In the study, which was just published in the journal Science, all of the non-condensing greenhouse gases and aerosols were zeroed out, and the global climate model was run forward in time to see what would happen to the greenhouse effect. A companion study led by GISS co-author Gavin Schmidt that has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research shows that carbon dioxide accounts for about 20 percent of the greenhouse effect, water vapor and clouds together account for 75 percent, and minor gases and aerosols make up the remaining five percent. However, it is the 25 percent non-condensing greenhouse gas component, which includes carbon dioxide, that is the key factor in sustaining Earth’s greenhouse effect. By this accounting, carbon dioxide is responsible for 80 percent of the radiative forcing that sustains the Earth’s greenhouse effect.

The researchers have determined that this major pulse of warming may have been more complex than scientists previously believed, according to the Physorg.com article. The study was conducted on fossils collected from the Bighorn Basin in north-central Wyoming. Scientists look to that period because the magnitude of warming seen then, about 10-15 degrees Fahrenheit, is similar to the warming expected across the globe over the next century or two. Scientists are trying to better understand the consequences of this ancient warming in hopes of being able to better predict the consequences of future warming, according to Physorg.com. \"Many scientists have thought that warming was the direct result of the release of this light carbon, but we found evidence from stable isotopes that warming actually preceded the release of this light carbon,\" said Ross Secord, assistant professor of Earth and atmospheric sciences and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the University of Nebraska State Museum. \"This implies that there were two sources of warming.\" (via Physorg.com) Greenhouse gases released from north Atlantic volcanoes or the \"lining up\" of Earth's orbital cycles could have caused the first round of warming, Secord speculated.

Along with that, they also made some predictions about the global temperatures for 2011 and 2012. As many of you already know, the summer of 2010 was the 4th warmest on record, according to GISS records, which date back to 1880. The summer of 2009 was the second warmest. According to GISS, the reason 2010 was a bit cooler than 2009 was the recent transition to a moderate La Nina. GISS also points out that Antarctica was unusually cold for the winter months of 2010, while the winter of 2009 was relatively mild. Antarctic temperature anomalies fluctuate chaotically from year to year, so this is not unusual according to GISS. Other key statements from the NASA GISS press release.......... ...the temperature anomaly in one place in one season has limited relevance to global trends. Unfortunately it is common for the public to take the most recent local seasonal temperature anomaly as indicative of long-term climate trends. This does not mean that local anomalies are unrelated to global trends, but it is necessary to look at statistics. 8 of the last 10 summers were warmer than the 1951-1980 mean in the United States and Japan, and 10 of 10 in Europe. So if you are perceptive and old enough, you should be able to notice a trend toward warmer seasons. ----- The above map provides an indication of the likely effect of the current cooling trend on the rank of the 2010 calendar year temperature anomaly. The maps compare January-August temperature anomalies for 2010, 2005 (the warmest year in the GISS analysis), and 1998 (one of the warmest years in the GISS analysis, the temperature being boosted by the \"El Nino of the century\"). 2010 is clearly the warmest of these years for the first eight months. However,the above map shows that the monthly anomalies in 2010 have declined steadily over the past five months as the Pacific Ocean moved into the La Niña phase. The last four months of 2005 (green line) were unusually warm, so it is not possible to say yet whether 2005 or 2010 will be the warmest calendar year in the GISS analysis. It is likely that the 2005 and 2010 calendar year means will turn out to be sufficiently close that it will be difficult to say which year was warmer. --------- Projections of trends over the next few years are possible based on the following considerations: (1) the planet is out of energy balance by at least several tenths of one W/m2 due to the rapid increase of greenhouse gases during the past few decades, as confirmed by measurements of changing ocean heat content, (2) inertia of energy systems that assures continuing growth of atmospheric CO2 by about 2 ppm per year for the next few years, (3) expectation that the solar irradiance will climb out of the recent long-lasting solar minimum, as shown in Figure 5, (4) model projections suggesting that the current La Niña may bottom out near the end of 2010. Given the dominant effect of El Niño-La Niña on short-term temperature change and the usual lag of a few months between the Nino index and its effect on global temperature, it is unlikely that 2011 will reach a new global record temperature. In contrast, it is likely that 2012 will reach a record high global temperature. Given the association of extreme weather and climate events with rising global temperature, the expectation of new record high temperatures in 2012 also suggests that the frequency and magnitude of extreme events could reach a high level in 2012 . ---- I wonder if they also watched a certain recent Hollywood disaster movie or a particular calendar in regards to the above underlined statement.

In the hydrological cycle fresh water evaporates from the oceans, rains onto the land and flows into rivers which then empty into the oceans.

According to the EurekAlert article , most climate models have suggested that evapotranspiration would increase with global warming. But, in large portions of the world (Southern Hemisphere in this study), soils are now becoming drier than they used to be, releasing less water and offsetting some moisture increases elsewhere. Starting in 1998, this significant increase in evapotranspiration slowed dramatically or stopped. The rather abrupt change from increased global evapotranspiration to a near halt in this process coincided with a major El Nino event in 1998, the researchers note in their report, but they are not suggesting that is a causative mechanism for a phenomenon that has been going on for more than a decade now, according to EurekAlert. Due to the limited number of decades for which data are available, scientists say they can't be sure whether this is a natural variability or part of a longer-lasting global change. But one possibility is that on a global level, a limit to the acceleration of the hydrological cycle on land has already been reached. What are the possible impacts of this? 1. Reduced terrestrial vegetation growth. 2. Less carbon absorption. 3. Natural cooling mechanism from evapotranspiration is reduced. 4. Greater heating of the land surface. 5.

In September 2007, the total extent of sea with surface ice shrank further than ever recorded before - to nearly 40 per cent below the long-term average. This low has yet to be surpassed. That year (2007) saw a build-up of high pressure over the Beaufort Sea and a trough of low pressure over northern Siberia - a weather pattern called the Arctic dipole anomaly. It brings warm, southerly winds that increase melting. The winds also drive sea ice away from the Siberian coast and out of the Arctic Ocean towards the Atlantic, where it melts, according to NewScientist. That dipole anomaly did not dominate in 2008 and 2009, thus the extent of ice did not shrink as much in the summer compared to 2007. This year, the dipole dominated again late in the spring and early summer resulting in the lowest ever (records going back to 1979) Arctic sea ice extent for the month of June. But in July, the dipole broke up and the rate of ice loss slowed, likely eliminating any chance for a new record minimum this year. Check out the latest graph of sea ice extent below from the NSIDC..... As the article correctly states, this rebound led to much talk across the media and blogosphere of a recovery in Arctic sea ice. Well, there is indeed a lot more to sea ice than area alone. According to ICESat the average thickness of Arctic Sea Ice is now less than 3 meters. ICESat is the only satellite that can measure the height and thus thickness of sea ice. Unfortunately, ICESat was only launched in 2003, so beyond that we only have the fairly accurate estimates from PIOMAS. See image below..... According to PIOMAS estimates supplied to New Scientist by Zhang, the average volume of Arctic ice between July and September has fallen from 21,000 cubic kilometres in 1979 to 8000 cubic kilometres in 2009. That is a 55 per cent fall compared with the 1979 to 2000 average. \"The loss of ice volume is faster than the loss of ice extent,\" says Zhang. His model suggests that not only has the total volume of Arctic ice continued to decline since 2007, but that the rate of loss is accelerating. (from NewScientist) How can ice volume have kept falling when extent increased again after 2007? Because less and less ice is surviving to see its first birthday. \"First-year ice is now the dominant ice type in the Arctic, whereas a few years ago multi-year ice was dominant,\" says David Barber, an environmental scientist from the University of Manitoba. And while the area of young ice increased in 2008 and 2009, the amount of multi-year ice continued to fall. \"There wasn't a recovery at all,\" Barber says. Worryingly, the melting of the Arctic sea ice is proceeding considerably more quickly than most climate models have predicted, says Cecilia Bitz of the University of Washington in Seattle. According to the 2007 models, the Arctic will not become ice-free in summer until some time after 2050. However, researchers like Barber and Serreze (NSIDC) think this landmark occurrence will come much earlier. Barber has predicted that it will occur sometime between 2013 and 2030, according to NewScientist.

A University of Calgary climate scientist has supposedly come up with a better way to engineer the climate on a global scale in order to prevent dangerous global warming. Releasing engineered nano-sized disks or sulphuric acid, a condensable vapor, above the Earth are two novel approaches that offer advantages over simply putting sulphur dioxide gas into the atmosphere, says Dr. David Keith, a director in the Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy and a Schulich School of Engineering professor. Many have feared that geoengineering could have serious \"side-effects\" and that the risks are too high. However, \"It cannot offset the risks that come from increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\" Keith says. \"If we don't halt man-made CO2 emissions, no amount of climate engineering can eliminate the problems-massive emissions reductions are still necessary.\" One benefit of using sulphates is that scientists have some understanding of their effects in the atmosphere because of emissions from volcanoes such as Mt. Pinatubo (below), Keith says. Scientists investigating geoengineering have so far looked mainly at injecting sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere. This approach imitates the way volcanoes create sulphuric acid aerosols, or sulphates, that will reflect solar radiation back into space--thereby cooling the planet's surface, according to University of Calgary press release. According to Keith, the distribution of engineered nano-particles above the Earth could be more controlled and less likely to harm the planet's protective ozone layer. The study included computer modeling that showed that the sulphuric acid would quickly condense in a plume, forming smaller particles that would last longer in the stratosphere and be more effective in reflecting solar radiation than the large sulphates formed from sulphur dioxide gas, according to EurekAlert.

An aerosol is a suspension of very fine particles of a solid, or of droplets of a liquid, in a gaseous medium. Fog, smoke, and volcanic dust are naturally occurring examples of aerosols. Sulfates are salts that contain a charged group of sulfur and oxygen atoms: SO42minus, the basic constituent of sulfuric acid. The sulfate particles in the atmosphere are about 0.1 to 1.0 micrometer (a millionth of a meter) in diameter and are particularly concentrated over industrial areas. They contribute to acid rain, cause lung irritation, and have been a main culprit in causing the haze that obscures a clear view of the Grand Canyon, according to the University of Washington. Aerosols can cool the climate in two basic ways: either directly, under clear sky conditions, by reflecting away some of the incoming solar radiation, or indirectly, by increasing the reflectivity of clouds. Scientists know for a fact that sulfates can cool the earth thanks to actual observed temperature decreases following major volcanic eruptions. The research team from The Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology used a global climate model with different sulfate aerosol concentrations depending on latitude to run five simulations. They then determined what distribution of sulfates would bring them closest to climate goals by using the results from the simulations in an optimization model. These distributions were then tested in the global climate model to see how close they came to these goals., according to the Dailytech. Aerosols injected into the stratosphere by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo cooled the Earth for several years after the eruption. Image courtesy of NASA. The results from his climate models showed that more sulfate over the poles rather than tropical regions would result in a low-carbon climate. But when sulfates were distributed uniformly, changes in the water cycle were \"most effectively diminished.\" If the right amount of uniformly distributed aerosols were injected into the stratosphere, the consequence of climate change could be decreased by 90 percent and the change in runoff would be decreased by two-thirds. But when aerosols are distributed latitudinally as a parabola, temperature change decreased by 94 percent while runoff changes were only cut in half, according to the Dailytech article.

During the mid-20th century, temperatures rose from the start of the century to the 1940s, fell slightly during the middle part of the century, and rose rapidly from the mid-1970s onwards.

Scientists are still not sure why the northern hemispheric oceans cooled so rapidly around 1970, but it appears that this cooling and not an increase in aerosol pollution may be responsible for the temporary global warming hiatus. The international team of scientists discovered an unexpectedly abrupt cooling event that occurred between roughly 1968 and 1972 in Northern Hemisphere ocean temperatures. The research indicates that the cooling played a key role in the different rates of warming seen in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres in the middle 20th century, according to the EurekAlert release.

In the warming world Arctic sea ice has been steadily decreasing, while Antarctic sea ice has been increasing. Why is that? Image courtesy of the Polar Research Group at the University of Illinois. Researchers from Georgia Tech try to come up with an explanation........ Excerpts from the GT story...... For the last half of the 20th Century, as the atmosphere warmed, the hydrological cycle accelerated and there was more precipitation in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. This increased precipitation, mostly in the form of snow, stabilized the upper ocean and insulated it from the ocean heat below. This insulating effect reduced the amount of melting occurring below the sea ice. In addition, snow has a tendency to reflect atmospheric heat away from the sea ice, which reduced melting from above. However, the climate models predict an accelerated warming exceeding natural variability with increased loading of greenhouse gases in the 21st century. This will likely result in the sea ice melting at a faster rate from both above and below. Here’s how it works. Increased warming of the atmosphere is expected to heat the upper ocean, which will increase the melting of the sea ice from below. In addition, increased warming will also result in a reduced level of snowfall, but more rain. Because rain doesn’t reflect heat back the way snow does, this will enhance the melting of the Antarctic sea ice from above. Image courtesy of the NSIDC. \"We may see, on a time scale of decades, a switch in the Antarctic, where the sea ice extent begins to decrease,\" said Judith A.

Sea levels vary because of natural processes on Earth on timescales from thousands to hundreds of millions of years. In the past they have been more than 120 meters (393 feet) higher than present day levels, according to the ABC Science article . \"The reality is we live on a dynamic planet - even in the absence of human-induced warming, sea levels would still change dramatically because it's been doing it for a very long time,\" Muller says. While the causes of long and very short term (less than 2 million years) changes in sea level are well understood, Muller suggests there are also cycles of change on intermediate timescales of between 2 and 20 million years, according to ABC Science. The cycles are too slow to be caused by melting ice sheets and too fast to be due to the gradual growth and destruction of volcanic ridges in the centre of ocean basins, which Muller and colleagues identified as the cause for long-term sea level change. The big question is what could be causing the intermediate cycles? One explanation for these intermediate cycles was put forward by Dr. Kenni Petersen from Aarhus University in Denmark. Petersen's research indicates sea levels may change at a regional scale due to heat from below the earth's crust, which forces the sea floor to rise.

The folks from RealClimate were kind enough to recently post the english version of this article. If you want a quick understanding of this year's sea ice extent and what it really means, just read the full article . Anyway, I will highlight some of what was said in the article....... Members of Notz's working group participated in a field experiment this past winter along the west coast of Greenland. The team was to study the growth and decay of sea ice through an entire winter. Temperatures the first half of this past winter were nearly 10 celsius above-normal in West Greenland, while large parts of Europe were froze out. A stable sea ice did not form for the working group to study until February. Since it as a very thin ice, it ended up completely melting by mid-May. Arctic sea ice extent this past winter remained well below the long-term mean. In March, temperatures dropped for a couple of weeks, leading to the formation of a thin ice cover, which caused a marked increase in observed sea-ice extent. For the measurement of this extent, it doesn’t matter at all how thick the ice is: any ice, however thin, contributes to sea-ice extent. Therefore, only considering a possible \"recovery\" of just the extent of Arctic sea ice always remains somewhat superficial, since sea-ice extent contains no information on the thickness of the ice. A much more useful measure for the state of Arctic sea ice is therefore the total sea-ice volume. However, for its (sea ice volume) estimation one additionally requires information on the overall distribution of ice thickness, which we have not been able to measure routinely in the past. While this will hopefully change in the future because of the successful launch of the Cryosat 2 satellite a couple of weeks ago, at the moment we unfortunately must rely on judging the current state of the Arctic sea-ice cover mostly by its extent. Due to the very low thickness of sea-ice, it was not surprising to see the rapid loss leading up to the record low June sea-ice extent, according to Notz. The retreat slowed down in July, but remained well-below normal. Currently, the ice covers an area that is slightly larger than the extent in late July of the record year 2007. However, this does not really allow for any reliable projections regarding the future evolution of Arctic sea ice in the weeks to come. The reason for this is mostly that sea ice in the Arctic has become very thin. Hence, in contrast to the much thicker ice of past decades, the ice now reacts very quickly and very sensitively to the weather patterns that are predominant during a certain summer. This currently limits the predictability of sea-ice extent significantly. At the moment all that remains is to wait and to check again and again the latest data of Arctic sea-ice extent, according to Notz.

Wintertime Antarctic sea ice is increasing at a small rate and with substantial natural year-to-year variability in the time series. While Antarctic sea ice reached a near-record-high annual minimum in March 2008, this does not indicate a significant long-term trend. To borrow an analogy from sports, one high day, month, or even year of sea ice is no more significant than one early-season win would be in predicting whether the hometown team will win the Super Bowl ten seasons from now. Another important point is that the increase in Antarctic sea ice extent is not surprising to climate scientists. When scientists refer to global warming, they don’t mean warming will occur everywhere on the planet at the same rate. In some places, temporary cooling may even occur. Antarctica is an example of regional cooling. Even our earliest climate models projected that Antarctica would be much slower in responding to rising greenhouse gas concentrations than the Arctic. In large part, this reflects the nature of the ocean structure in Antarctica, in which water warmed at the surface quickly mixes downward, making it harder to melt ice. In terms of sea ice, climate model projections of Antarctic sea ice extent are in reasonable agreement with the observations to date. It also appears that atmospheric greenhouse gases, as well as the loss of ozone, have acted to increase the winds around Antarctica. Perhaps counter intuitively, this has further protected the Antarctic from warming and has fostered more ice growth. Finally, even if wintertime Antarctic sea ice were to increase or decrease significantly in the future, it would not have a huge impact on the climate system. This is because during the Antarctic winter energy from the sun is at its weakest point; its ability or inability to reflect the sun’s energy back into space has little affect on regulating the planet’s temperature.

After a couple months of steady decline, the rate of ice loss during this current melt season began to slow during the first half of this month (July). According to the NSIDC, a significant change in the atmospheric circulation was responsible for this change. Through much of May and June, high pressure dominated the Beaufort Sea with low pressure over Siberia. Winds associated with this pattern, known as the dipole anomaly, helped speed up ice loss by pushing ice away from the coast and promoting melt, according to the NSIDC. This new atmospheric cyclone pattern, which took hold in early July is quite common in summer. The low-pressure cells have brought cooler and cloudier conditions over the Arctic Ocean. They have also promoted a cyclonic (anticlockwise) sea ice motion, which acts to spread the existing ice over a larger area. (from NSIDC) Here is a plot of the latest Arctic sea ice extent compared to the 1979-2000 average and the record low year of 2007.

One thing that has annoyed me over the years is the amount of cherrypicking that I see on the internet and news media in regards to temperature and sea ice anomaly trends. If you have the data, your best way to get toward the right answer in terms of climate science is by looking the long-term trends. I constantly see stories, blogs and videos picking out just a handful of years or even months/weeks to make a declaration about the current and future climate. This is climate science not meteorology. I show monthly temperature data from different sources on this blog so you can be kept up do date with the latest information. That is all. I do not make claims that a months worth of data means that global warming is accelerating or that the planet is going into a long-term cooling event. Let's say for fun that the IPCC projections for global warming over this century will end up close to correct, which is for a 3-7 F temperature increase by the end of the century. That increase in temperature is not going to be in an upward straight line as some people seem to think it should be. There will be shorter periods within the long-term rise where temperatures remain steady or even fall. There are always fluctuations in a long-term trend. Many of these short term changes will end up statistically insignificant in the long-term. All of our answers are not coming today, tomorrow, next month, next year or even 10 years from now. We have to avoid knee jerk reactions to small blips. Speaking of trends, let's take a look at the latest long-term global temperature trends from a variety of sources. Judge for yourself.

According to the article, studies have shown that solar variability has significantly influenced past climate changes. In general, more sunspots (blue peaks) mean more intense solar activity and more energy received by the Earth. A decrease in solar is believed to have triggered significant cooling periods. Remember the Maunder Minimum back in the 1600's and early 1700's. Current estimates through proxy data and satellites indicate that the sun is probably now as active as or more active than it has ever been during the past 8,000 years, but even if that is indeed true, scientists can't account for all of the warming observed at the end of the 20th century.

Using three independent methods of measuring the Pliocene temperatures on Ellesmere Island in Canada's high Arctic, the team's findings indicate that CO2 levels of approximately 400 parts per million are sufficient to produce mean annual temperatures in the High Arctic of approximately 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees F). \"As temperatures approach 0 degrees Celsius, it becomes exceedingly difficult to maintain permanent sea and glacial ice in the Arctic. Thus current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere of approximately 390 parts per million may be approaching a tipping point for irreversible ice-free conditions in the Arctic,\" according to Ashley Ballantyne of the University of Colorado. Today, Ellesmere Island is a polar desert that features tundra, permafrost, ice sheets, sparse vegetation and a few small mammals. Temperatures range from roughly minus 37 degrees F, or minus 38 degrees C, in winter to 48 degrees F, or 9 degrees C, in summer. The region is one of the coldest, driest environments on Earth, according to EurekAlert. According to Ballantyne, Arctic temperatures have risen by about 1.8 degrees F, or 1 degree C, in the past two decades in response to anthropogenic greenhouse warming, a trend expected to continue in the coming decades and centuries. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have risen from about 280 parts per million during the pre-industrial era on Earth to about 390 parts per million today. Ellesmere Island Elevated Arctic temperatures during the Pliocene -- which occurred shortly before Earth plunged into an ice age about 2.5 million years ago -- are thought to have been driven by the transfer of heat to the polar regions and perhaps by decreased reflectivity of sunlight hitting the Arctic due to a lack of ice, said Ballantyne. One big question is why the Arctic was so sensitive to warming during this period, he said. Multiple feedback mechanisms have been proposed to explain the amplification of Arctic temperatures, including the reflectivity strength of the sun on Arctic ice and changes in vegetation seasonal cloud cover, said Ballantyne. \"I suspect that it is the interactions between these different feedback mechanisms that ultimately produce the warming temperatures in the Arctic.\" (from EurekAlert).

The new study, which was conducted by the Carnegie Institute, tested the climate consequences of this type of geoengineering by using a computer simulation of the global climate system, according to EurekAlert. Surprisingly, the computer modeling showed that the oceanic clouds caused the land surface to become cooler and wetter on average. In previous climate simulations diminishing solar radiation by geoengineering had reduced precipitation on land. \"The drying of the continents has been a major concern with regard to geoengineering,\" says Ken Caldeira. But in the model the runoff from the continents increased by 7.5% globally, with the effect being strongest in the tropics. Caldeira stresses that their study, in which all marine clouds worldwide were uniformly whitened, cannot be used to predict the geographic patterns of rainfall that might develop as a result of geoengineering. \"In real life, there are only certain parts of the ocean in which you could make the cloud droplets smaller,\" he says.

I also link to the Cryosphere Today website, which is run by the Polar Research Group from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and tracks the northern and southern hemispheric sea ice area. A simplified way to think of extent versus area is to imagine a slice of swiss cheese, according to the NSIDC. Extent would be a measure of the edges of the slice of cheese and all of the space inside it. Area would be the measure of where there is cheese only, not including the holes. That is why if you compare extent and area in the same time period, extent is always bigger. Today, I am going to show you the anomaly trend of the Arctic sea ice volume.

PIOMAS is a numerical model with components for sea ice and ocean and the capacity for assimilating observations. PIOMAS has been extensively validated through comparisons with observations from US-Navy submarines, moorings, and satellites.

Yet the data are too useful for scientific studies to be kept under wraps, so we will continue to make the data available on a monthly basis. The weather variability issue can alleviated by stressing the need to focus on the frequency and magnitude of warm and cold anomalies, which change noticeably on decadal time scales as global warming increases. 12-month running mean temperatures provide more information than the usual graphs with calendar-year mean temperature. The 12-month running mean fully removes the annual cycle, which exists even in temperature anomaly time series. The magnitude and duration of global temperature effects of volcanoes and the Southern Oscillation can be seen much more clearly in a 12-month running mean graph.

According to Dr. James Hansen, who is the director of GISS in New York, the new record is particularly meaningful because it occurs when the recent minimum of solar irradiance is having its maximum cooling effect. Also, the tropical Pacific Ocean has changed from warm El Nino conditions to ENSO-neutral and is likely headed into the cool La Nina phase of the Southern Oscillation. The 12-month running mean global temperature may continue to rise for a few more months before the ENSO change causes the next decline. It is likely that global temperature for calendar year 2010 will exceed the 2005 record, but that is not certain if a deep La Nina develops quickly, says Hansen. 12-month running mean global temperature since 1880.

This is a satellite image of western Greenland from NASA. The narrow grey band in the center of the image is melting ice, between the rocky coast to the left (west) and thicker, non-melting, higher altitude ice to the right (east). Building icecaps press down the land beneath and lower its elevation due to the tremendous weight. As an icecap melts, there is less force pushing down on the land and the land actually begins to spring back upward. According to the study, some coastal areas are going up by nearly one inch per year and if current trends continue, that number could accelerate to as much as two inches per year by 2025, according to Tim Dixon, professor of geophysics and lead investigator. The measurements are restricted to places where rock is exposed, limiting the study to coastal areas. However, previous data indicate that ice in Greenland's interior is in approximate balance: yearly losses from ice melting and flowing toward the coast are balanced by new snow accumulation, which gradually turns to ice. Most ice loss occurs at the warmer coast, by melting and iceberg calving, according to The EurekAlert release. Since the land underneath Greenland is rising at an accelerated pace it means that the melting of the icecap is accelerating as well. A nice image from the air of a portion of the Greenland coast.

According to a Nepalese Sherpa named Apa, climbers are struggling to get traction on sections of the mountain as rising temperatures have melted much of the ice on a steep trail to the summit, leaving exposed rock, which is much more difficult to maneuver with the use of crampons. Apa, who has set a world record of 20 ascents to the summit, said that there was hardly any exposed rock on the trail to the summit when he first climbed Everest in 1989, but now the slopes are dotted with bare rocks.

If anything, there are indications that we may be trending toward La Nina by the end of the summer, which is the abnormal cooling of the sea surface waters of the equatorial Pacific.

Instead of consistent 90 degree days, the Midwest is experiencing more days in the 80s with higher humidity that do not cool down as much at night, according to the Chicago Tribune story.

Backed by a decade of research, David Changnon, a climate scientist at Northern Illinois believes that more densely planted corn and soybean fields scattered across the Midwest are changing the regional climate by releasing more water vapor into the atmosphere.

According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. (NSIDC). April temperatures were about 3 to 4 degrees Celsius (5 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit) above average across much of the Arctic Ocean, and up to 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal in northern Canada! The main reason for the near-normal ice extent was the unusually late start to the melt season on March 31st, which is almost a month later than normal. The late start was due to the expansion in the southernmost Bering Sea, Barents Sea, and Sea of Okhotsk. These areas remained cool, with northeasterly and northwesterly winds, keeping the overall ice extent close to the average for the month of April. -------------- Update Here is the latest chart of the Arctic sea ice extent through early May, and as you can see, there has been a recent downward acceleration. It will be interesting to track this through the summer. Image courtesy of the NSIDC. -------------- The Polar Research Group from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign also keeps track of the sea ice area in both the northern and southern hemisphere. As you can see below, the annual sea ice area anomaly in the northern hemisphere since 1979 shows a clear, long-term, downward trend. If you just look at the last 3 years, it has leveled off. We will have to wait and see if this leveling off will continue or is it just some noise in the overall trend. If we look at the southern hemisphere, there has been a slight upward trend since 1979.

When scientists refer to global warming, they don’t mean warming will occur everywhere on the planet at the same rate. In some places, temporary cooling may even occur. Antarctica is an example of regional cooling. Even our earliest climate models projected that Antarctica would be much slower in responding to rising greenhouse gas concentrations than the Arctic. In large part, this reflects the nature of the ocean structure in Antarctica, in which water warmed at the surface quickly mixes downward, making it harder to melt ice. (excerpt from the NSIDC). ----------- What is the difference between sea ice area and extent? (from the NSIDC site) Area and extent are different measures and give scientists slightly different information. Some organizations, including Cryosphere Today, report ice area; NSIDC primarily reports ice extent. Extent is always a larger number than area, and there are pros and cons associated with each method. A simplified way to think of extent versus area is to imagine a slice of swiss cheese. Extent would be a measure of the edges of the slice of cheese and all of the space inside it. Area would be the measure of where there is cheese only, not including the holes. That is why if you compare extent and area in the same time period, extent is always bigger. A more precise explanation of extent versus area gets more complicated.

Keep this thought in mind, as the oceans get warmer, less CO2 is absorbed. Here is a copy of his full post. Feel free to chime in! --------- SOME PRETTY COMPELLING EVIDENCE ON WHAT IS DRIVING CO2 The table below shows c02 increases on Mt Loa since 1959. One can notice the spiking of co2 when el ninos occur, and how the co2 increases were higher when the PDO went warm. This further supports my idea that we are going to get our answer as to what is causing the warming. Cycles of c02 and the evidence that the co2 RESPONDS to warming not causes is pretty straightforward with co-ordinating the data. The real kick in the teeth of co2 being the driver is the big fall with the Pinitubo cooling! Anyway look for yourself check this out: COLD PDO YEARS year ppm/yr 1959 0.95 1960 0.51 1961 0.95 1962 0.69 1963 0.73 el nino starts 1964 0.29 el nino ends 1965 0.98el nino starts 1966 1.23el nino ends 1967 0.75 1968 1.02 el nino starts 1969 1.34 el nino 1970 1.02el nino ends 1971 0.82 1972 1.76 el nino starts 1973 1.18 el nino ends 1974 0.78 1975 1.10 1976 0.92 el nino starts WARM PDO STARTING: 1977 2.09 el nino ends, starts 1978 1.31 el nino ends 1979 1.68 1980 1.80 1981 1.43 1982 0.72 el nino starts 1983 2.16 el nino ends 1984 1.37 1985 1.24 1986 1.51 el nino starts 1987 2.33 el nino 1988 2.09 el nino ends 1989 1.27 1990 1.31 1991 1.02 el nino starts 1992 0.43 PINITUBO!

The most damming of the evidence against co2 being the driver was the drop around 1992 with Pinitubo cooling. To the rationale, objective person, does this look like co2 with its erratic up and downs around the times of el ninos, is the driver, or the driven. The answer is obvious, it is responding to spikes that occur with warming episodes, the driven, not the driver. You can see the response in co2 with and after the nino. So my idea of seeing how all this turns out using objective satellite measurements with the cold pdo seems perfectly logical. To NOT see this as a possibility, if not a likelihood, and not being willing to see how this plays out seems disingenuous to me. Another little fact that escapes people, or is not talked about. Many more people live within 40 degrees in the equator than within 40 degrees of the poles. Why? Because its easier to live where its warm. Combine this with the fact that we never hear what a defined optimum temp for the earth is, or for how much co2 we should have, should ring alarm bells. The trees you see outside did not pull earth out of the ground, but through the cyclical nature of growth pull nutrients out of the AIR and ground, and much of the weight of that tree had its origin in THE AIR. But these side issues to me are not the main issue. A forecast has been made by me for the next 20 years, and its a simple experiment, backed up with sound ideas on this. It is not ridiculous, but instead not understanding why this should occur, and not allowing this to play out, is what is ridiculous. Joe Bastardi.

Now, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has now confirmed that March 2010 was the warmest March on record (land and ocean surface temperature combined) going back 130 years to 1880. The average temperature for March 2010 globally was 56.3 F and was 1.39 F (0.77 C) above the 20th century average. The old March record holder was March 2002 (+0.74 C). Keep in mind, El Nino (abnormal warming of the surface waters along the equatorial Pacific) was still present in March, but in a weakening state. Most of Canada was again engulfed by abnormally warm conditions during March 2010. Mean temperature records were set or tied across Ontario, Canada, as mean temperatures were 2.5°-8.1°C above the March average, according to Environment Canada. (from NOAA). ------------- The annual maximum sea ice extent in the Arctic was achieved on the latest date in the satellite record, but as you can see by the chart below, the 31-year anomaly trend in sea ice extent for the month of March is still in the negative despite some recovery over the past few years. The key data will come in at the end of the melt season in August and September. Down in the Antarctic, the March sea ice extent anomaly has been fairly variable over the past few years but still with a positive trend since 1979. In regards to Antarctic sea ice.......from the National Snow and Ice Data Center..... The increase in Antarctic sea ice extent is not surprising to climate scientists. When scientists refer to global warming, they don?t mean warming will occur everywhere on the planet at the same rate. In some places, temporary cooling may even occur.

It also appears that atmospheric greenhouse gases, as well as the loss of ozone, have acted to increase the winds around Antarctica. Perhaps counter intuitively, this has further protected the Antarctic from warming and has fostered more ice growth.

Jones was at the center of the hacked email controversy, otherwise known as 'climategate' that surfaced at the end of last year. The review, led by Lord Oxburgh, gave scientific processes at CRU a \"clean bill of health\", but did raise some issues of concern, according to the Guardian. The report concluded that the scientists from CRU did not fudge their results, but noted that they were disorganized. ------------ Here are some of the final conclusions directly from the Independent Inquiry. 1. We saw no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice in any of the work of the Climatic Research Unit and had it been there we believe that it is likely that we would have detected it. Rather we found a small group of dedicated if slightly disorganised researchers who were ill-prepared for being the focus of public attention. 2. We cannot help remarking that it is very surprising that research in an area that depends so heavily on statistical methods has not been carried out in close collaboration with professional statisticians. Indeed there would be mutual benefit if there were closer collaboration and interaction between CRU and a much wider scientific group outside the relatively small international circle of temperature specialists. 3. We observed that there were important and unresolved questions that related to the availability of environmental data sets. It was pointed out that since UK government adopted a policy that resulted in charging for access to data sets collected by government agencies, other countries have followed suit impeding the flow of processed and raw data to and between researchers. This is unfortunate and seems inconsistent with policies of open access to data promoted elsewhere in government. --------- The Oxburgh review follows a report on the CRU emails last month from the Commons Science and Technology Select Committee, which also cleared the scientists involved of wrongdoing.

The study was led by NCAR's Kevin Trenberth. Roughly half of the world's heat energy that has built up over recent years is unaccounted for, according to the study, which was funded by the National Science Foundation, NCAR's sponsor, and by NASA. This 'missing' heat energy is likely building up in the deep oceans or elsewhere in the climate system on earth that current observational tools such as satellite sensors and ocean floats are unable to track. Excerpts from the Physorg.com article: Satellite instruments indicate that greenhouse gases are continuing to trap more solar energy, or heat, but scientists since 2003 have been unable to determine where much of that heat is going. Either the satellite observations are incorrect, says Trenberth, or, more likely, large amounts of heat are penetrating to regions that are not adequately measured, such as the deepest parts of the oceans. Compounding the problem, Earth's surface temperatures have largely leveled off in recent years. Yet melting glaciers and Arctic sea ice, along with rising sea levels, indicate that heat is continuing to have profound effects on the planet. Tracking the growing amount of heat on Earth is far more complicated than measuring temperatures at the planet's surface. The oceans absorb about 90 percent of the solar energy that is trapped by greenhouse gases. Additional amounts of heat go toward melting glaciers and sea ice, as well as warming the land and parts of the atmosphere. Only a tiny fraction warms the air at the planet's surface. Until 2003, the measured heat increase was consistent with computer model expectations. But a new set of ocean monitors since then has shown a steady decrease in the rate of oceanic heating, even as the satellite-measured imbalance between incoming and outgoing energy continues to grow. Some of the missing heat appears to be going into the observed melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, as well as Arctic sea ice, the authors say.

Diagram showing eccentricity. The eccentricity (e) of an orbit indicates the deviation of the orbit from a perfect circle. A circular orbit has an eccentricity of 0, while a highly eccentric orbit is closer to (but always less than) 1. Professor Lorraine Lisiecki examined ocean sediment cores from 57 locations around the world to determine that there was indeed a clear correlation between the timing of the change in orbit and a change in the earth's climate. Lisiecki also found a surprising correlation. She discovered that the largest glacial cycles occurred during the weakest changes in the eccentricity of Earth's orbit -- and vice versa. She found that the stronger changes in the Earth's orbit correlated to weaker changes in climate, according to the UCSB Press Release . \"This may mean that the Earth's climate has internal instability in addition to sensitivity to changes in the orbit,\" said Lisiecki.

Sloan Professor of Meteorology, Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT, recently wrote an op-ed for the Fredericksburg, VA Star explaining why evidence suggests that man-made global warming is greatly exaggerated and that natural variabilities are enough to account for global temperature changes since the 19th century. Here are some excerpts from Lindzen's piece 'The Fact is, Earth is Never in Equilibrium' ........... In a world where we experience temperature changes of tens of a degree in a single day, we treat changes of a few tenths of a degree in some statistical residue, known as the global mean temperature anomaly (GATA), as portents of disaster. For small changes in GATA, there is no need for any external cause. The Earth is never exactly in equilibrium. The motions of the massive oceans where heat is moved between deep layers and the surface provides variability on time scales from years to centuries. Examples include El Nino, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation, etc. Recent work suggests that this variability is enough to account for all change in the globally averaged temperature anomaly since the 19th century. Lindzen also explains that positive feedbacks in the climate system are poorly handled by global climate models and that there is substantial evidence that the feedbacks may actually be negative rather than positive. The IPCC claim that most of the recent warming (since the 1950s) is due to man assumed that current models adequately accounted for natural internal variability. The failure of these models to anticipate the fact that there has been no statistically significant warming for the past 14 years or so contra-dicts this assumption. Global warming enthusiasts have responded to the absence of warming in recent years by arguing that the past decade has been the warmest on record. We are still speaking of tenths of a degree, and the records themselves have come into question. Since we are, according to these records, in a relatively warm period, it is not surprising that the past decade was the warmest on record. This in no way contradicts the absence of increasing temperatures for over a decade. According to Lindzen, man's emissions of CO2 must have some impact, but the big question is how much? -------------- Here is full version of the op-ed from the Fredericksburg Star.

Soil respiration includes carbon dioxide from both plants and soil microbes, and is a major component of the global carbon cycle.

Part of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The Atlantic overturning circulation is a system of currents, including the Gulf Stream, that bring warm surface waters from the tropics northward into the North Atlantic, preventing North America, Europe and north Africa from being much colder than what they are now. In the seas surrounding Greenland, the water cools, sinks to great depths and changes direction. What was once warm surface water heading north turns into cold deep water going south. This overturning is one part of the vast conveyor belt of ocean currents that move heat around the globe, according to the Physorg.com article. The latest climate models predict the overturning circulation will slow down as greenhouse gases warm the planet and melting ice adds freshwater to the ocean. \"Warm, freshwater is lighter and sinks less readily than cold, salty water,\" explains Josh Willis of NASA's JPL. Combining satellite and float measurements, Willis found no change in the strength of the circulation overturning from 2002 to 2009. Looking further back with satellite altimeter data alone before the float data were available, Willis found evidence that the circulation had sped up about 20 percent from 1993 to 2009. This is the longest direct record of variability in the Atlantic overturning to date and the only one at high latitudes. \"The changes we're seeing in overturning strength are probably part of a natural cycle,\" said Willis. \"The slight increase in overturning since 1993 coincides with a decades-long natural pattern of Atlantic heating and cooling.\" Willis also says that if and when the circulation slows, the results will unlikely be dramatic.

Earth was also being bombarded by asteroids 3.9 billion years ago. One potential answer was offered back in 1993 by atmospheric scientist, Jim Kasting. Kasting's calculations showed that 30% of the earth's atmosphere 4 billion years ago consisted of carbon dioxide, which provided an effective \"greenhouse\" around the planet. However, new research has discovered another reason for \"the missing ice age\". It's not the CO2, but cloud cover. One of the authors of this new study, Professor Minik Rosing, from the Natural History Museum of Denmark explains, \"What prevented an ice age back then was not high CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, but the fact that the cloud layer was much thinner than it is today. In addition to this, the earth's surface was covered by water. This meant that the sun's rays could warm the oceans unobstructed, which in turn could layer the heat, thereby preventing the earth's watery surface from freezing into ice. The reason for the lack of clouds back in earth's childhood can be explained by the process by which clouds form. This process requires chemical substances that are produced by algae and plants, which did not exist at the time. These chemical processes would have been able to form a dense layer of clouds, which in turn would have reflected the sun's rays, throwing them back into the cosmos and thereby preventing the warming of earth's oceans.\" The researchers also determined through analysis of 3.8 billion year old mountain rock that the atmosphere at the time contained a maximum of one part per thousand of this greenhouse gas. This was three to four times more than the atmosphere's CO2-content today. However, not anywhere in the range of the of the 30% share in early earth history , which has hitherto been the theoretical calculation. Hence we may conclude that the atmosphere's CO2- content has not changed substantially through the billions of years of earth's geological history. However, today the graph is turning upward, according to the story from EurekAlert.

This triggered a rapid cooling period nearly 13,000 years ago, otherwise known as the Big Freeze or Younger Dryas. The flood path originated from the Laurentide Ice Sheet and then routed up into Canada and into the Arctic Ocean. With huge amounts of fresh water mixing with the salt water of the Arctic Ocean more sea-ice was created, which flowed into the North Atlantic, causing the northward continuation of the Gulf Stream to shut down. Without the heat being brought across the Atlantic by the Gulf Stream, temperatures in Europe plunged from similar to what they are today, back to glacial temperatures with average winter temperatures of -25 C.

In talking specifically about the climate models, here are some excerpts from the story...... If policymakers don't heed the models, \"you're throwing away information. And if you throw away information, then you know less about the future than we actually do,\" said Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. \"You can say, 'You know what, I don't trust the climate models, so I'm going to walk into the middle of the road with a blindfold on,' \" Schmidt said. \"But you know what, that's not smart.\" Climate scientists admit that some models overestimated how much the Earth would warm in the past decade. But they say this might just be natural variation in weather, not a disproof of their methods. \"We're never going to perfectly model reality. We would need a system as complicated as the world around us,\" said Ken Fleischmann, a professor of information studies at the University of Maryland. He said scientists needed to make the uncertainties inherent in models clear: \"You let people know: It's a model. It's not reality. We haven't invented a crystal ball.\" Scientists say they don't need models to know that the world is warming: There is plenty of real-world evidence, gathered since the mid-1800s, to suggest that. \"There's no climate model in that conclusion,\" said Christopher Field, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in California. But Warren Meyer, a mechanical and aerospace engineer by training who blogs at www.climate-skeptic.com, said that climate models are highly flawed. He said the scientists who build them don't know enough about solar cycles, ocean temperatures and other things that can nudge the earth's temperature up or down. He said that because models produce results that sound impressively exact, they can give off an air of infallibility. NASA's Schmidt counters......

The most rapid rate of increase was recorded for the Delaware River near Chester, Pennsylvania. The greatest increases in temperature were found near the most highly urbanized areas, which can be partly blamed on the heat-island effect. ------------ Here is the abstract of the study from the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"8ca0c573de1a8b17c2be0aaf3a1862857913e69d"}

The paper states that there has been no reduction in the global warming trend since the late 1970's. According to the paper (page 28)......... Climate trends can be seen clearly if we take the 60-month (5-year) and 132-month (11-year) running means through January 2010. The 5-year mean is sufficient to minimize El-Nino variability, while the 11-year mean also minimizes the effect of solar variability. We conclude that there has been no reduction in the global warming trend of 0.15-0.20 C per decade that began in the late 1970's. See the below charts...... The paper (page 15) also says that 2010 will likely set a new record high global surface temperature, unless El Nino rapidly weakens by mid-2010 and gets replaced by La Nina conditions. Some models do continue to show a steady weakening of El Nino by the summer, so it will be interesting to see what happens. According to NASA (via Climate Progress), this new record temperature will be particularly meaningful because it occurs when the recent minimum of solar irradiance is having its maximum cooling effect. ------------ If you are not up to reading the entire report , which is 32 pages long, there is a much shorter, less technical summary from the dailygreen.

The IPCC used a report from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as the basis for its claim. A clearing along the Amazon Rainforest. The new study, which was published in the Geophysical Research Letters, looked at the effects of major drought in the Amazon rainforest during 2005 when rainfall fell to the lowest level in living memory.

Professor Ranga Myneni, from the climate and vegetation research group at Boston University who was the senior researcher in the study, said criticized the IPCC's claim that a \"even a slight reduction in precipitation\" would cause drastic changes in the rainforest. According to the Telegraph, he said: \"There was more than a slight reduction in precipitation during the drought of 2005.

A new study from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which was published in the Geophysical Research Letters has found that even if the Sun enters another long period of low activity (low # of sunspots) similar to the \"Maunder Minimum\" , it will still not be able to stop the rise of global temperatures caused by greenhouse gases. If the Sun lacks spots, that means there is a reduction in magnetic energy, signifying a lower energy output (or a slight reduction in brightness, or \"irradiance\"). Typically, every 11 years, the Sun goes through peaks and troughs in energy output (known as solar maximum and minimum, respectively) and this abnormally long minima is largely attributed with contributing toward the Little Ice Age, according to the Discovery News Article. UN appointed climatologists predict that global average temperatures will rise between 3.7 and 4.5 C by the end of the century. But, even if the sun enters another Grand Minimum the reduction in solar energy will slow heating by a paltry 0.3 degrees Celsius by the end of this century.

Their letter was in response to errors that were uncovered in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The opening statement of the letter basically states that the errors that have been found in the 4th Assessment Report of the IPCC do not even remotely undermine the IPCC's conclusion that \"warming of the climate system is unequivocal\" and that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely due to observed increase in man-made greenhouse gas concentrations. The letter also points out that there have been a number of mis-statements by the media and members of Congress in regards to this story. But, they also point out that the IPCC needs to be more forthcoming in openly acknowledging errors in a timely fashion. Here are some excerpts from the letter......... ....the current decadal period of stable global mean temperature does nothing to alter a fundamental conclusion from the AR4: warming has unequivocally been observed and documented. ....the majority of studies from a large number of research groups in the US and elsewhere project that unabated emissions could produce between 1 and 6 degrees C more warming through the year 2100. Errors The wrong year for the projected disappearance of the Himalayan glaciers and the wrong percentage of 'land below sea level' in the Netherlands are examples of errors that need to be acknowledged frankly and rectified promptly. Recent events have made it clear that the quality control procedures of the IPCC are not watertight, but claims of widespread and deliberate manipulation of scientific data and fundamental conclusions in the AR4 are not supported by the facts. We also strongly contest the impression that the main conclusions of the report are based on dubious sources. The reference list of the AR4 contains about 18,000 citations, the vast majority of which were published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. We propose implementing a topic-based cross-chapter review process by which experts in an impact area of climate change, such as changes in water resources, scrutinize the assessment of related vulnerability, risk analyses, and adaptation strategies that work downstream from such changes. The impression that the IPCC does not have a proper quality-control procedure is deeply mistaken. The procedure for compiling reports and assuring its quality control is governed by well-documented principles that are reviewed regularly and amended as appropriate. We conclude that the IPCC procedures are transparent and thorough, even though they are not infallible. Nonetheless, we are confident that no single scholar or small group of scholars can manipulate the process to include or to exclude a specific line of research; authors of that research can (and are fully encouraged to) participate in the review process. Moreover, the work of every scientist, regardless of whether it supports or rejects the premise of human-induced climate change, is subject to inclusion in the reports. The work is included or rejected for consideration based on its scientific merit. ...we are pleased that an independent critical evaluation of IPCC procedures will be conducted: we hope that the process will solicit participation by the National Academies of the member nations. --------- You can read the full letter right here.

A second study which analyzed 159 species of butterflies at 10 locations over a 35-year period found that butterflies in the Sierra Nevada are moving to higher elevations to escape the warming. Around the world there is lots of evidence that butterflies are emerging earlier and that's partly because humans have had a long interest in observing butterflies and so we have excellent records going back in time on butterflies, according to Michael Kearney, lead-author of the Melbourne study in an interview with ABC's \"The World Today\". Co-author David Karoly, a professor in the university's School of Earth Sciences who contributed the climate modeling, said the study directly ties earlier butterfly emergence to a regional temperature increase and then ties that increase to a rise in greenhouse gas concentrations caused by humans.

DAVID KAROLY: Regional warming is just part of global warming and if we average the regional warming across lots and lots of different regions then we end up with global climate change. ....there may be other more likely effects such as warming associated with changes in land use, say the increase in urbanisation in Melbourne.

Gore does acknowledge the flawed overestimate of the Himalayan glaciers and that scientists from the University of East Anglia (climategate e-mails) may not have adequately followed the requirements of the British freedom of information law.

If you do not have the time to read the op-ed, here are some excerpts from Gore's commentary through the New York Times........ I, for one, genuinely wish that the climate crisis were an illusion. But unfortunately, the reality of the danger we are courting has not been changed by the discovery of at least two mistakes in the thousands of pages of careful scientific work over the last 22 years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ...panel's scientists.......probably underestimated the range of sea-level rise in this century, the speed with which the Arctic ice cap is disappearing and the speed with which some of the large glacial flows in Antarctica and Greenland are melting and racing to the sea. The heavy snowfalls this month have been used as fodder for ridicule by those who argue that global warming is a myth, yet scientists have long pointed out that warmer global temperatures have been increasing the rate of evaporation from the oceans, putting significantly more moisture into the atmosphere -- thus causing heavier downfalls of both rain and snow in particular regions, including the Northeastern United States. Though there have been impressive efforts by many business leaders, hundreds of millions of individuals and families throughout the world and many national, regional and local governments, our civilization is still failing miserably to slow the rate at which these emissions are increasing -- much less reduce them. This period of market triumphalism (1990's) coincided with confirmation by scientists that earlier fears about global warming had been grossly understated. But by then, the political context in which this debate took form was tilted heavily toward the views of market fundamentalists, who fought to weaken existing constraints and scoffed at the possibility that global constraints would be needed to halt the dangerous dumping of global-warming pollution into the atmosphere. The pathway to success is still open, though it tracks the outer boundary of what we are capable of doing. It begins with a choice by the United States to pass a law establishing a cost for global warming pollution.

The retreating terminus of Stephens Glacier in Alaska. According to Erik Schiefer, a geographer from the Northern Arizona University (NAU), previous studies have largely overestimated mass loss from Alaskan glaciers over the past 40-plus years. The study also concluded that glacier melt in Alaska between 1962 and 2006 contributed about one-third less to sea-level rise than previously estimated, according to the NAU press release. The research team calculated that melting glaciers in Alaska contribute about .0047 inches to sea-level rise per year, compared to earlier estimates which put that number at .0067 inches per year. The numbers sound small, but as Schiefer said, \"It adds up over the decades.\" The study looked at three-fourths of all ice in Alaska using satellite imagery that spans vast areas of ice cover. Two factors led to the original overestimation of ice loss with this older method of flying planes that flew along the centerlines of selected glaciers to measure ice surface elevations. One is the impact of thick deposits of rock debris that offer protection from solar radiation and, thus, melting. The other was not accounting for the thinner ice along the edges of glaciers that also resulted in less ice melt, according to Schiefer. While the team determined a lower rate of glacial melt during a greater than 40-year span, Schiefer said other studies have demonstrated the rate of ice loss has more than doubled in just the last two decades, according to the NAU release.

Many environmentalists tout the benefits of locally grown food because it travels fewer miles, creating fewer carbon emissions. But a bigger impact of growing food locally is the relationship communities build with the earth, Lappe said.

Scientists are not sure if these emissions are new or have been going on for centuries, but the amount of methane (8 million tonnes) that is seeping from under the melting permafrost is equivalent to the annual total previously estimated from all of the world's oceans. The gas is released by rotting vegetation. Previously, the sea floor had been considered an impermeable barrier sealing methane, says Shakhova. Current methane concentrations in the Arctic are the highest in 400,000 years, according to the ABC Science report. Scientists are not sure if this venting of methane is caused by global warming or natural factors, but they note that the projected rise in global temperatures will quicken the thaw, which will release even more methane. Study co-author Dr Natalia Shakhova, a scientist at the University of Fairbanks, Alaska, noted that there is an \"urgent need\" to monitor the region for possible future changes since permafrost traps vast amounts of methane. Monitoring could resolve if the venting was \"a steadily ongoing phenomenon or signals the start of a more massive release period,\" according to the scientists, based at US, Russian and Swedish research institutions.

Jones is the director (not currently acting director) of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia, which was at the center of the hacked e-mails back in December. I have posted just a few of the questions and answers from the BBC article. You can read the whole article right here . ----------- (BBC) Do you agree that from 1995 to the present there has been no statistically-significant global warming? (Jones) Yes, but only just. I also calculated the trend for the period 1995 to 2009. This trend (0.12C per decade) is positive, but not significant at the 95% significance level. The positive trend is quite close to the significance level. Achieving statistical significance in scientific terms is much more likely for longer periods, and much less likely for shorter periods. According to the DailyMail (UK) article.....He further argued that this was a blip rather than the long-term trend. (BBC) Do you agree that from January 2002 to the present there has been statistically significant global cooling? (Jones) No. This period is even shorter than 1995-2009. The trend this time is negative (-0.12C per decade), but this trend is not statistically significant. --- Here are some maps and graphs that look at the temperature trends since 1995 from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and Remote Sensing Systems (RSS). Monthly mean global temperature trend. The satellite measured lower tropospheric temperature anomaly trend from RSS. (BBC) There is a debate over whether the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was global or not. If it were to be conclusively shown that it was a global phenomenon, would you accept that this would undermine the premise that mean surface atmospheric temperatures during the latter part of the 20th Century were unprecedented? There is much debate over whether the Medieval Warm Period was global in extent or not. The MWP is most clearly expressed in parts of North America, the North Atlantic and Europe and parts of Asia. For it to be global in extent the MWP would need to be seen clearly in more records from the tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere. There are very few palaeoclimatic records for these latter two regions. Of course, if the MWP was shown to be global in extent and as warm or warmer than today (based on an equivalent coverage over the NH and SH) then obviously the late-20th century warmth would not be unprecedented. On the other hand, if the MWP was global, but was less warm that today, then current warmth would be unprecedented. We know from the instrumental temperature record that the two hemispheres do not always follow one another. We cannot, therefore, make the assumption that temperatures in the global average will be similar to those in the northern hemisphere. ---- According to the Daily Mail version of the story , climate change advocates have dismissed the MWP as false or only applying to the northern part of the world and that Jones' new statement to the BBC is a departure from this consensus. Skeptics said this was the first time a senior scientist working with the IPCC had admitted to the possibility that the Medieval Warming Period could have been global, and therefore the world could have been hotter then than now. ------------ UPDATE The climate scientists from Real Climate dispute parts of the Daily Mail's version of the story about Dr. Phil Jones interview with the BBC and point out a number of distortions.

According to Tony Lupo, professor and chair of the atmospheric science department at the MU College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources, atmospheric blocking occurs between 20-40 times each year and usually lasts between 8-11 days. Lupo believes that heat sources, such as radiation, condensation, and surface heating and cooling, have a significant role in a blocking's onset and duration. Therefore, planetary warming could increase the frequency and impact of atmospheric blocking. It is anticipated that in a warmer world, blocking events will be more numerous, weaker and longer-lived, Lupo said. \"This could result in an environment with more storms.

The UK's Guardian has supposedly uncovered evidence that a series of measurements from Chinese weather stations were seriously flawed (from a 1990 study) and that documents relating to them could not be produced. These claims by the Guardian are based on their investigation of thousands of emails and documents that were illegally hacked from the University of East Anglia's climatic research unit a couple months ago. The result of this incident was \"climategate\". The temperature data from the Chinese weather stations measured the warming there over the past half century and appeared in a 1990 paper in the prestigious journal Nature, which was cited by the IPCC's latest report in 2007, according to the Guardian. Direct excerpts from the Guardian (authored by Fred Pearce)....... It also further calls into question the integrity of the scientist at the centre of the scandal over hacked climate emails, the director of the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit (CRU), Dr Phil Jones. The emails suggest that he helped to cover up flaws in temperature data from China that underpinned his research on the strength of recent global warming. Jones and his Chinese-American colleague Wei-Chyung Wang, of the University at Albany in New York, are being accused of scientific fraud by an independent British researcher over the contents of a research paper back in 1990. That paper, which was published in the prestigious journal Nature, claimed to answer an important question in climate change science: how much of the warming seen in recent decades is due to the local effects of spreading cities, rather than global warming? The pair, with four fellow researchers, concluded that the urban influence was negligible. Some of their most compelling evidence came from a study of temperature data from eastern China, a region urbanizing fast even then.

Water vapor is a powerful, widespread greenhouse gas. A water vapor image from GOES satellite, courtesy of NOAA The researchers claim that this drop has substantially slowed the rate of warming at the earth's surface in recent years, according to the US News article. The research team's modeling suggests that the rate of increase in the average global surface temperature from 2000 to 2009 was about 25 percent lower than it otherwise would have been, the researchers report. The team?s analysis using a climate model suggest that average global surface temperatures rose only 0.1 degrees Celsius (0.18 F) during that period, rather than the 0.14 degree C (0.25 F) increase expected because of increases in other greenhouse gases, according to US News. One possible cause is that the amount of water vapor rising into the stratosphere at tropical latitudes has decreased, due to shifts in global sea-surface temperatures that influence rates of evaporation and water vapor movement. Even though the effect seems to be substantial, the decrease in water vapor may be temporary, says Andrew Dessler of Texas A&M University.

The title of his study is 'On the Reliability of the U.S. Temperature Record' Here is the link. In the study, Menne evaluated and compared temperature trends of poor vs. well suited U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) sites in response to photo evidence by surfacestations.org of widespread poor siting conditions of these sites across the country. Anthony Watts (Watt's Up with That), in particular, has speculated that U.S. surface temperature records from the USHCN from the past 30 years or so are likely biased high due to poor siting near buildings, asphalt, A/C, etc....., which is artificially enhancing the magnitude of observed temperature trends. Excerpts from the study....... Results indicate that there is a mean bias associated with poor exposure sites relative to good exposure sites; however, this bias is consistent with previously documented changes associated with the widespread conversion to electronic sensors in the USHCN during the last 25 years. Moreover, the sign of the bias is counterintuitive to photographic documentation of poor exposure because associated instrument changes have led to an artificial negative (cool) bias in maximum temperatures and only a slight positive (warm bias ) in minimum temperatures. Adjusted USHCN temperatures are extremely well aligned with recent measurements from instruments whose exposure characteristics meet the highest standards for climate monitoring. We find no evidence that the Continental U.S. temperature trends are inflated due to poor station siting. The average continental U.S. trend since 1980 is nearly the same when calculated using adjusted (homogenized) data from good or poor exposure sites. In contrast, when calculated from unadjusted values, the continental U.S. average maximum trend is significantly smaller from the poor exposure sites relative to the trend from good exposure sites. The biggest difference in the trend shows up during the mid and late 1980's, when about 60% of the USHCN sites converted from the liquid in glass models to the electronic max/min temperature system. By the way, poor exposure sites are predominantly electronic max/min sites. The reason why station exposure does not play an obvious role in temperature trends probably warrants further investigation, according to the researchers. --------------- To be fair, Anthony Watts wrote a response to this in his blog back on January 27th.

Some past analyses of carbon release have been based on studies of Canadian forests that are quite different than many U.S. forests, they said. The B&B fire complex in Oregon from 2003. The past estimates of fire severity and the amounts of carbon release have often been high and probably overestimated in many cases, said Beverly Law, a professor of forest ecosystems and society at OSU. The B&B fire from space (courtesy of NASA) Key excerpts from the OSU press release....... Even when a very severe fire kills almost all of the trees in a patch, the scientists said, the trees are still standing and only drop to the forest floor, decay, and release their carbon content very slowly over several decades. Grasses and shrubs quickly grow back after high-severity fires, offsetting some of the carbon release from the dead and decaying trees. And across most of these Metolius burned areas, the researchers observed generally abundant tree regeneration that will result in a relatively fast recovery of carbon uptake and storage. Since fire events are episodic in nature while greenhouse gas emissions are continuous and increasing, climate change mitigation strategies focused on human-caused emissions will have more impact than those emphasizing wildfire, the researchers said. Fire suppression has resulted in a short-term reduction of greenhouse gases, the researchers said, but on a long-term basis fire will still be an inevitable part of forest ecosystems. Timber harvest also has much more impact on carbon dynamics than fire. Because of this, forest fires will be a relatively minor player in greenhouse gas mitigation strategies compared to other factors, such as human consumption of fossil fuels, they said.

The coldest temperature ever recorded on earth is -128.6 F (-89.2C), which was recorded at Russia's Vostok Station in Antarctica back in July of 1983. Scientists now have a pretty good idea of why the temperature dropped to a whopping 54 degrees colder than the winter average at Vostok during that particular day in 1983. A computer model (yea, I know those two words make some of you cringe) used by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the Arctic/Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) along with weather charts and satellite imagery was used to solve the mystery of how it got so cold. The research teams determined that relatively warm air that normally flows over the Southern Ocean onto the high Antarctic plateau almost came to a halt during this period in 1983. A flow of cold air circling Vostok was preventing the mixing of this warmer air from lower latitudes, isolating the station and causing near optimum cooling conditions, according to the LiveScience article. Also, the absence of a heat-trapping cloud cover and the presence of diamond dust (tiny ice particles) in the air allowed a maximum of heat to escape into space. John Turner of the BAS and colleagues think that the same combination of circumstances lasting over a longer period of time in the future could make the thermometer at Vostok drop as far down as -141 F (-96 C)!

But, that claim was based on a non-peer reviewed story from New Scientist, that was actually published eight years before the IPCC's 2007 report. That story was actually based on a short telephone interview with Syed Hasnain. Supposedly, this claim was \"speculation\" and not supported by any formal research, according to Hasnain.

I might be wrong, but I believe this article may have been posted in response to some of the recent allegations against this process of temperature adjustment. Key excerpts from the NCDC.......... The number of land surface weather stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) drops off in recent years. This fact is an indication of our success in adding historical data. The weighting scheme used to rate stations for the initial selection in the GSN clearly indicates the biases climatologists have in favor of stations that have been in operation for a long time, that are rural, are agricultural research sites, and are distributed throughout the world with increasing density the farther they are away from the tropics. The result of all these efforts is that GHCN has data for many thousands of stations in the period from the 1950s to the 1990s that cannot be routinely updated, thus the number of stations drops considerably in recent years. What corrections are needed to remove known biases in the individual data? Existing data have well documented biases in them. The most important bias globally was the modification in measured sea surface temperatures associated with the change from ships throwing a bucket over the side, bringing some ocean water on deck, and putting a thermometer in it, to reading the thermometer in the engine coolant water intake. The bucket readings used early in the record were cooler than engine intake observations so the early data have been adjusted warmer to remove that bias. This makes global temperatures indicate less warming than the raw data. The NCDC identified which GHCN stations were rural and which were urban. Then the NCDC created global temperature time series from the rural only stations and compared that to our full dataset. The result was that the two showed almost identical time series (actually the rural showed a little bit more warming) so there apparently was no lingering urban heat island bias in the adjusted GHCN dataset. In ocean data, over the last decade an international effort led by NOAA has dramatically increased the number of drifting buoys providing sea surface temperature data. Recent preliminary analysis of co-located ship and buoy data indicates that buoy data are colder than ship observations . Therefore, the increase in cold buoy data may be bringing in a cold bias into recent ocean temperature analysis. ------------- In the U.S. specifically, there has been a shift from afternoon observing times (warmer) to morning observing times (cooler) since 1970, which has resulted in a cool bias that was addressed by applying a correction to the data. Comparing the long term adjusted with the long term raw GHCN data. According to the NCDC, both times series indicate the earth is warming and that the observed warming cannot be an artifact of the adjustment process.

Turfgrass lawns help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and store it as organic carbon in soil, making them important \"carbon sinks.\" However, greenhouse gas emissions from turfgrass management, including nitrous oxide, which is 300 times more powerful than carbon dioxide, are four times greater than the amount of carbon stored by ornamental grass in parks, the UC Irvine study shows. Turfgrass is increasingly widespread in urban areas and covers 1.9 percent of land in the continental U.S., making it the most common irrigated crop, according to the UC Irvine report. \"Lawns look great - they?re nice and green and healthy, and they?re photosynthesizing a lot of organic carbon.

But how can that be? Especially when one recent study claimed that there has been less surface melting on the giant ice sheet in recent years and the evidence that the amount of sea ice around Antarctica has been slightly increasing. Pine Island Glacier. Image courtesy of NASA. According to NASA, the answer is that ice can flow without melting. Key excerpts from the article......... Using radar information collected between 1992 and 1996, oceanographer Eric Rignot, based at NASA?s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), found that the Pine Island Glacier's \"grounding line\" -- the line between the glacier's floating section and the part of the glacier that rests on the sea floor -- had retreated rapidly towards the land. That meant that the glacier was losing mass. He attributed the retreat to the warming waters around West Antarctica. But with only a few years of data, he couldn't say whether the retreat was a temporary, natural anomaly or a longer-term trend from global warming. A major review published in 2009 found that Rignot's Pine Island Glacier finding hadn't been a fluke: a large majority of the marine glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula were retreating, and their retreat was speeding up. This summer, a British group revisited the Pine Island Glacier finding and found that its rate of retreat had quadrupled between 1995 and 2008. The retreat of West Antarctica's glaciers is being accelerated by ice shelf collapse. Ice shelves are the part of a glacier that extends past the grounding line towards the ocean they are the most vulnerable to warming seas. A longstanding theory in glaciology is that these ice shelves tend to buttress (support the end wall of) glaciers, with their mass slowing the ice movement towards the sea. Michael Schodlok, a JPL scientist who models the way ice shelves and the ocean interact, says melting of the underside of the shelf is a pre-requisite to these collapses. Thinning of the ice shelf reduces its buttressing effect on the glacier behind it, allowing glacier flow to speed up. The oceans surrounding Antarctica have been warming, so Schodlok doesn't doubt that the ice shelves are being undermined by warmer water being brought up from the depths, but he cannot prove it. This dynamic process of ice flowing downhill to the sea is what enables Antarctica to continue losing mass even as surface melting declines. Also, measurements from the Grace satellites confirm that Antarctica is losing mass 11. Isabella Velicogna of JPL and the University of California, Irvine, uses Grace data to weigh the Antarctic ice sheet from space. Her work shows that the ice sheet is not only losing mass, but it is losing mass at an accelerating rate. \"The important message is that it is not a linear trend. A linear trend means you have the same mass loss every year. The fact that it?s above linear, this is the important idea, that ice loss is increasing with time,\" she says. ------------------- You can read the entire article right here.

The north coast of Israel. According to a new study supervised by Dr. Dorit Sivan, Head of the Department of Maritime Civilizations at the University of Haifa, rises and falls in sea level over relatively short periods do not testify to a long-term trend. Dr. Sivan also stated that it is early yet to conclude from the short-term increases in sea level that this is a set course that will not take a change in direction. Direct excerpt from this EurekAlert story...... According to Dr. Sivan, the changing sea level can be attributed to three main causes: the global cause - the volume of water in the ocean, which mirrors the mass of ice sheets and is related to global warming or cooling; the regional cause - vertical movement of the earth's surface, which is usually related to the pressure placed on the surface by the ice; and the local cause - vertical tectonic activity. Seeing as Israel is not close to former ice caps and the tectonic activity along the Mediterranean coast is negligible over these periods, it can be concluded that drastic changes in Israel's sea levels are mainly related to changes in the volume of water. Using data deduced from many coastal archaelogical findings, Dr. Sivan concluded the following......... \"Over the past century, we have witnessed the sea level in Israel fluctuating with almost 19 centimeters (~8 inches) between the highest and lowest levels. Over the past 50 years Israel's mean sea level rise is 5.5 centimeters (~2 inches), but there have also been periods when it rose by 10 centimeters (~4 inches) over 10 years. That said, even acute ups and downs over short periods do not testify to long-term trends.

Michael Smith and meteorologist Joseph D?Aleo (IceCap) have discovered extensive manipulation of the data within the U.S. Government's two primary climate centers: the National Climate Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, North Carolina and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) at Columbia University in New York City, according to meteorologist John Coleman of KUSI-TV, who is himself a noted global warming skeptic. These centers are being accused of creating a strong bias toward warmer temperatures through a system that dramatically trimmed the number and cherry-picked the locations of weather observation stations they use to produce the data set on which temperature record reports are based, according to the KUSI-TV report. Some excerpts from Coleman's blog on this story....... Smith and D'Aleo revealed there are no actual temperatures left in the computer database when it proclaimed \"2005 WAS THE WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD.\" In the transition to a computer averaging system, the National Data Climate Center deleted actual temperatures at thousands of locations throughout the world as it evolved to a system of global grid boxes. The number that goes into each grid box is determined by averaging the temperatures of two or more weather observation stations nearest that grid box. ...NCDC averages surrounding or nearby points and places that number in the box. In some cases those observations are from several hundreds of miles away. That produces a serious question, 'Does the resulting number represent the average temperature for that region within meaningful limits?'\" D'Aleo says it does not. \"A vital issue,\" he says is, \"temperatures are not linear over space, but instead vary enormously because of differences in terrain, elevation, vegetation, water versus land and urbanization.\" ....It is clear that comparing data from previous years when the final figure was produced by averaging a large number of temperatures and those produced from a much smaller temperature set with large data gaps is comparing apples and oranges. \"When the differences between the warmest year in history and the tenth warmest year is less than three quarters of a degree, it becomes silly to rely on such comparisons,\" Smith and D'Aleo say. But that is exactly what has been done in touting the late 1990s and the early 2000s as the warmest ten years in history. \"It is clearly a travesty and agenda- driven by global warming advocates,\" D'Aleo asserts. The number of actual weather observation points used as a starting point for world average temperatures has been reduced from about 6,000 in the 1970s to about 1,500 in the most recent years. Still, more stations are dropped out in related programs and in the final NASA/GIStemp data file, it drops to about 1,000. That leaves much of the world unaccounted for,\" says D'Aleo. Smith and D'Aleo say it is startling where the temperatures are that have been dropped from the calculation. \"A very high percentage of those dropped are from the more northern locations. Very few are left north of sixty degrees longitude.\" \"Clearly there is also a bias to leave in locations with warmer temperatures, i.e. from the arid areas and within the urban warmth of cities,\" he adds. In the greatest reduced list of locations, there are very few colder mountain locations retained.

The team combined data on current climate and temperature gradients worldwide with climate model projections for the next century to calculate the \"temperature velocity\" for different regions of the world. This velocity is a measure of how fast temperature zones are moving across the landscape as the planet warms, and how fast plants and animals will need to migrate to keep up, according to EurekAlert The average global velocity for the 21st century is 0.26 miles per year, but in areas of high topographic relief, where species can find cooler temperatures by climbing a nearby mountain, velocities are relatively low.

Knorr reanalyzed atmospheric CO2 and emissions data since 1850 and considers uncertainties in the data, according to ScienceDaily. It is shown that with those uncertainties, the trend in the airborne fraction since 1850 has been 0.7 +/- 1.4% per decade, or close to and not significantly different from zero (no trend). I would like to know what those uncertainties are. Only 40-45% of emitted CO2 stays in the atmosphere, according to the Knorr report. But, other recent studies suggest the possibility that the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems have started loosing part of their ability to sequester a large proportion of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Climate models currently assume that the amount of airborne CO2 from man-made emissions is increasing and will continue to do so, which is a key part of their long term predictions.

This graphic shows the running mean of the AO index going back to 1950. Red is positive phase, blue is negative. Here is a closer look at the most recent status of the AO (solid line) and the spread of ensemble forecasts going out to the second half of the month (red), which still show a -AO, but not nearly as extreme.

The (-AO) was also responsible for much of the Arctic air being forced much farther south than normal through southern Canada and well down into the lower 48 states during the month and into early January. Long range, weather forecasting models indicate that the Arctic Oscillation could remain mostly in the negative phase through the end of winter. The phase of the AO is described in terms of an index value. In December 2009 the AO index value was -3.41, the most negative value since at least 1950 , according to data from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center From the NSIDC....... The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is a natural pattern of climate variability. It consists of opposing patterns of atmospheric pressure between the polar regions and middle latitudes. The positive phase of the AO exists when pressures are lower than normal over the Arctic, and higher than normal in middle latitude. In the negative phase, the opposite is true; pressures are higher than normal over the Arctic and lower than normal in middle latitudes. The negative and positive phases of the AO set up opposing temperature patterns. With the AO in its negative phase this season, the Arctic is warmer than average, while parts of the middle latitudes are colder than normal.

Remote Sensing Systems did not have that information available as of this writing, but the kind folks at the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH) already released their satellite measured temperature data for the month. The (UAH) globally averaged temperature departure for December was +0.28 C. As we all know, we are in the midst of a moderate El Nino, which usually contributes to an overall increase in global temperatures. So why did the temperature anomaly drop from a +0.50 in November to the +0.28 in December as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index slightly increased (meaning toward a stronger El Nino)? I think a lot had to do with the extreme negative Arctic Oscillation (-AO), which I blogged about yesterday. There are some indications that our current El Nino may be peaking with the latest three-monthly averaged index number at a +1.5. El Nino is characterized with 5 consecutive overlapping 3-month seasons of at least a +0.5 index or higher. An increase in easterly winds in the central, tropical Pacific have recently shown up, which would eventually lead to some upwelling of cooler water toward the surface down there. Also, as you can see below, a majority of the computer modeling suggest that this El Nino will begin to weaken late in the winter and spring (downward trend), so maybe this will not end up being the warmest year on record as some have hinted.

The anomaly for the North Polar region was +1.96C, which is warm, but look at the North polar ocean anomaly....+3.16 C, which pretty much agrees with what the NSIDC was talking about in terms of the -AO and the relative extreme warmth up in the Arctic Ocean for December.

He also told the Guardian..... \"It comes as a surprise to me that people would try to use my statements to try to dispute the nature of global warming. I believe in manmade global warming. I have said that if my name was not Mojib Latif it would be global warming.\" He added: \"There is no doubt within the scientific community that we are affecting the climate, that the climate is changing and responding to our emissions of greenhouse gases.\" According to the Mail, \"The BBC assured viewers that the big chill was was merely short-term 'weather' that had nothing to do with 'climate', which was still warming.

Nevertheless, despite the plethora of more convincing explanations for varying levels of malarial illness, policy-makers and government departments continue to state, without any qualification, that malaria will become very much more prevalent in a warmer world. The battle against the severe threat from climate change is therefore impeded, not helped, by government departments issuing alarmist and exaggerated alerts based on poor science. According to the article, there are several other significant factors that can influence the spread of Malaria just as much as temperature........ --Presence of stagnant water in open, sunlit fileds after deforestation. --Increased population pressure. --Lack of available mosquito nets and their use.

Professor Paul Reiter of the Pasteur Institute in Paris points out that malaria transmission is a complex matter and that rising temperatures are only weakly linked to an increasing incidence of malaria.

IEA analysts say Russian meteorological stations cover most of the country's territory, and that the Hadley Center had only used 25% of such stations in its reports. Over 40% of Russian territory was not included in global-temperature calculations for unknown reasons, rather than the lack of meteorological stations and observations, according to the IEA.

Here is their response....... The World Meteorological Organisation chooses the set of stations designated as essential climate stations that have been released by the Met Office. These are evenly distributed across the globe and provide a fair representation of changes in global average temperature over land. We do not choose these stations and therefore it is impossible for the Met Office to fix the data. The global temperatures record, HadCRUT has been shown to underestimate the rise in global average temperatures over the past 30 years when compared against a fuller analysis of global temperatures. This analysis includes information from a wide range of sources such as satellites, radiosondes, and sea surface temperature data, but does not include surface observations used in HadCRUT, so is fully independent. The analysis shows that HadCRUT under-estimates the warming in the Russian region, in particular, because of the limited availability of Northern Hemisphere high latitude observations. The Met Office is keen to publish all underpinning station data as it becomes available. We are already in the process of seeking agreement to release the underpinning data from its owners.

The result of this melting from moderate warming would produce a relatively rapid rise in global sea level. How much warming are they talking about? An additional two degrees on the global average, which could commit the planet to 6 to 9 meters (20-30 feet) of long-term sea level rise, which would permanently submerge New Orleans and other parts of southern Louisiana, much of southern Florida and other parts of the U.S. East Coast, much of Bangladesh, and most of the Netherlands, unless unprecedented and expensive coastal protection were undertaken, according to EurekAlert. Keep in mind, however, that such a rise would likely take centuries to complete, not days, like a recent Hollywood movie portrayed. The researchers determined through their analysis that there is a 95 percent probability that, during the last interglacial stage, global sea level peaked more than 6.6 meters (22 feet) above its present level. They further found that it is unlikely (with a 33 percent probability) that global sea level during this period exceeded 9.4 meters (31 feet). A key paragraph from the article....... . The findings indicate that sea level during the last interglacial stage rose for centuries at least two to three times faster than the recent rate, and that both the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheet likely shrank significantly and made important contributions to sea level rise. However, the relative timing of temperature change and sea level change during the last interglacial stage is fairly uncertain, so it is not possible to infer from the analysis how long an exposure to peak temperatures during this stage was needed to commit the planet to peak sea levels.

If you do not have time to read the link, then you can look at pieces of his post down below. Hansen's post was clearly triggered by the climategate story. Here are some excerpts from the op-ed by Dr. Hansen............ Fast forward to December 2009, when I gave a talk at the Progressive Forum in Houston Texas. The organizers there felt it necessary that I have a police escort between my hotel and the forum where I spoke. Days earlier bloggers reported that I was probably the hacker who broke into East Anglia computers and stole e-mails. Their rationale: I was not implicated in any of the pirated e-mails, so I must have eliminated incriminating messages before releasing the hacked e- mails. Each month we receive, electronically, data from three sources: weather data for several thousand meteorological stations, satellite observations of sea surface temperature, and Antarctic research station measurements. These three data sets are the input for a program that produces a global map of temperature anomalies relative to the mean for that month during the period of climatology, 1951-1980. These data sets, which cover the full period of our analysis, 1880-present, are available to parties interested in performing their own analysis or checking our analysis. The Southern Hemisphere had more steady warming through the century while the Northern Hemisphere had distinct cooling between 1940 and 1975. The different hemispheric records in the mid-twentieth century have never been convincingly explained. The most likely explanation is atmospheric aerosols, fine particles in the air, produced by fossil fuel burning. Aerosol atmospheric lifetime is only several days, so fossil fuel aerosols were confined mainly to the Northern Hemisphere, where most fossil fuels were burned. Aerosols have a cooling effect that still today is estimated to counteract about half of the warming effect of human-made greenhouse gases. -------------- Flaws in temperature analysis . Figure 2 (from the link) illustrates an error that developed in the GISS analysis when we introduced, in our 2001 paper, an improvement in the United States temperature record. This improvement, developed by NOAA researchers, adjusted station records that included station moves or other discontinuities. Unfortunately, I made an error by failing to recognize that the station records we obtained electronically from NOAA each month, for these same stations, did not contain the adjustments. The error was readily corrected, once it was recognized. The error averaged 0.15°C over the contiguous 48 states, but these states cover only 1½ percent of the globe, making the global error negligible. The small error in global temperature had no effect on the ranking of different years. The warmest year in our global temperature analysis was still 2005. Unfortunately, another data problem occurred in 2008. In one of the three incoming data streams, the one for meteorological stations, the November 2008 data for many Russian stations was a repeat of October 2008 data. It was not our data record, but we properly had to accept the blame for the error, because the data was included in our analysis. Occasional flaws in input data are normal in any analysis, and the flaws are eventually noticed and corrected if they are substantial. The obvious misinformation in these stories, and the absence of any effort to correct the stories after we pointed out the misinformation, suggests that the aim may have been to create distrust or confusion in the minds of the public, rather than to transmit accurate information. The lesson learned here was that even a transient data error, however quickly corrected provides fodder for people who are interested in a public relations campaign, rather than science. That means we cannot put the new data each month on our web site and check it at our leisure, because, however briefly a flaw is displayed, it will be used to disinform the public. ---------------- Strong correlation of global SST with the Nino index is obvious. Global land-ocean temperature is noisier than the SST, but correlation with the Nino index is also apparent for global temperature. On average, global temperature lags the Nino index by about 3 months. Indeed, it is likely that the sun is an important factor in climate variability. The direct climate forcing due to measured solar variability, about 0.2 W/m, is comparable to the increase in carbon dioxide forcing that occurs in about seven years, using recent CO2 growth rates. Although there is a possibility that the solar forcing could be amplified by indirect effects, such as changes of atmospheric ozone, present understanding suggests only a small amplification. -------------- Frequently heard fallacies are that \"global warming stopped in 1998\" or \"the world has been getting cooler over the past decade\". These statements appear to be wishful thinking - it would be nice if true, but that is not what the data show. True, the 1998 global temperature jumped far above the previous warmest year in the instrumental record, largely because 1998 was affected by the strongest El Nino of the century. Thus for the following several years the global temperature was lower than in 1998, as expected. However, the 5-year and 11-year running mean global temperatures (Figure 3b) have continued to increase at nearly the same rate as in the past three decades. Indeed, given the continued growth of greenhouse gases and the underlying global warming trend (Figure 3b) there is a high likelihood, I would say greater than 50 percent, that 2010 will be the warmest year in the period of instrumental data. This prediction depends in part upon the continuation of the present moderate El Nino for at least several months, but that is likely.

The more debate, the better. Some of the mainstream media is now catching on to this story, especially now that we are seeing some official investigations. Here are a few of the more interesting excerpts that I have read since yesterday..... From CBS News Aynsley Kellow, a professor at the University of Tasmania who was an expert reviewer for a U.N. global warming report, told ABC Radio there was evidence of a \"willingness to manipulate raw data to suit predetermined results, you've got a resistance to any notion of transparency, an active resistance to freedom of information requests or quite reasonable requests from scientists to have a look at data so that it can be verified.\" Hans von Storch, director of the Director of Institute for Coastal Research who was assailed by Mann in one e-mail message, calls the CRU axis a \" cartel \" and suggests that Jones and others avoid reviewing papers. Thomas Crowley, professor of geosciences at the University of Edinburgh, told the Washington Post that the CRU-leaked-files episode \"reflects badly on the people who are so desperate to discredit global warming.\" From the Penn State Daily Collegian. People with legitimate scientific concerns should be able to express them, meteorology professor Jenni Evans said, but if they are neither skillful nor courageous enough to express them in the right forum, scientists are not going to take any notice. \"I think that people that have to stoop to deception and theft probably don't have strong ground to stand on,\" she said. Evans said if scientists did listen to everything people tried to tell them to do, it would leave no opportunity for science to advance -- and no one would learn anything new. From the Wall Street Journal. What does all this have to do with climate catastrophe? The answer brings us to a scandal that is, in my opinion, considerably greater than that implied in the hacked emails from the Climate Research Unit (though perhaps not as bad as their destruction of raw data): namely the suggestion that the very existence of warming or of the greenhouse effect is tantamount to catastrophe. This is the grossest of \"bait and switch\" scams. It is only such a scam that lends importance to the machinations in the emails designed to nudge temperatures a few tenths of a degree.

Anyway, Christi states that ignorance of the climate system is very large and politicians who make policy change need to know this. Christi also stated that he is not sure if man has a full or partial role in climate change, but climate models certainly do not prove that he is responsible. Schmidt said that climate models are necessary tools that help provide evidence. Schmidt also stated that the 'climategate' emails were taken out of context and that the \"trick\" is just a technique used among scientists.

One way to avoid this is to build the equivalent of one new nuclear power plant each day, which of course is not possible. Tim Garrett, who is an associate Professor of Atmospheric Sciences and author of this study, says that it looks unlikely that there will be any near-term departure from the recent observed acceleration of CO2 emission rates, according to the EurekAlert article. A couple of key points made by Garrett........ 1. Energy conservation or efficiency doesn't really save energy, but instead spurs economic growth and accelerated energy consumption. \"Making civilization more energy efficient simply allows it to grow faster and consume more energy,\" says Garrett. He says the idea that resource conservation accelerates resource consumption - known as Jevons paradox ? was proposed in the 1865 book \"The Coal Question\" by William Stanley Jevons, who noted that coal prices fell and coal consumption soared after improvements in steam engine efficiency. 2. \"Stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions at current rates will require approximately 300 gigawatts of new non-carbon-dioxide-emitting power production capacity annually - approximately one new nuclear power plant (or equivalent) per day,\" Garrett says. \"Physically, there are no other options without killing the economy.\" In closing..... Garrett says colleagues generally support his theory, while some economists are critical. One economist, who reviewed the study, wrote: \"I am afraid the author will need to study harder before he can contribute.\" \"Fundamentally, I believe the system is deterministic,\" says Garrett. \"Changes in population and standard of living are only a function of the current energy efficiency. That leaves only switching to a non-carbon-dioxide-emitting power source as an available option.\" ------------------ Update My colleague from Accuweather.com, Ken Clark, who is the western weather expert has posted a solid commentary on the climate scientist email hacking story.

This is a bit of a stretch, right? Anyway, according to GMANews.TV, some women in poor, coastal countries are being driven into sex work due to climate change. Using the Philippines as an example, about 60% of the population are living in coastal areas that depend on the seas for livelihood. Women in this country are now forced to share the traditional role of the man in providing for the family, since overpopulation and overfishing have depleted the sea's resources, causing fisherman to lose their livelihood. So far, I do not see anything related to climate change. The article also mentions reduced income from farming due to climate change. But, Dr. Angel Alcala, a former Environment secretary, says that some women often pick out shellfish by the coastlines, which are exposed to storm surges. I assume they are implying that there are higher storm surges due to climate change, and that the women can no longer endure this work, which forces them to find other jobs, while other women go into prostitution.

I have been reading some of the responses from actual climate scientists in regards to this story and some of them might surprise you. From Eduardo Zorita , who was a contributing author of the 4th assessment report of the IPCC. Zorita has headed the Department of Paleoclimate and has been a senior scientist at the Institute for Coastal Research of the GKSS Research Centre in Germany. Zorita has published more than 70 peer-reviewed scientific studies. (courtesy of Climate Depot) . Some of Zorita's email correspondence with Briffa and Osborne was made public by the hacking. Key excerpt from Zorita ......... I may confirm what has been written in other places: research in some areas of climate science has been and is full of machination, conspiracies, and collusion, as any reader can interpret from the CRU-files. They depict a realistic, I would say even harmless, picture of what the real research in the area of the climate of the past millennium has been in the last years. The scientific debate has been in many instances hijacked to advance other agendas. These words do not mean that I think anthropogenic climate change is a hoax. On the contrary, it is a question which we have to be very well aware of. But I am also aware that in this thick atmosphere -and I am not speaking of greenhouse gases now- editors, reviewers and authors of alternative studies, analysis, interpretations,even based on the same data we have at our disposal, have been bullied and subtly blackmailed. In this atmosphere, Ph D students are often tempted to tweak their data so as to fit the 'politically correct picture'. Some, or many issues, about climate change are still not well known. Policy makers should be aware of the attempts to hide these uncertainties under a unified picture. I had the 'pleasure' to experience all this in my area of research. Zorita states that in his opinion, Michael Mann, Phil Jones and Stefan Rahmstorf should be barred from the IPCC process. --------------------- Judy Curry , a climate scientist from the Georgia Institute of Technology, via Climate Audit........ I would like to provide an \"external but insider\" assessment and perspective. My perspective is as a climate researcher that is not involved directly in any of the controversies and issues in the purloined HADCRU emails, but as one that is familiar with this research, the surrounding controversies, and many of the individuals who sent these emails. Transparency Climate data needs to be publicly available and well documented. The HADCRU surface climate dataset needs public documentation that details the time period and location of individual station measurements used in the data set, statistical adjustments to the data, how the data were analyzed to produce the climatology, and what measurements were omitted and why. If these data and metadata are unavailable, I would argue that the data set needs to be reprocessed (presumably the original raw data is available from the original sources). Climate data sets should be regularly reprocessed as new data becomes available and analysis methods improve. Climate Tribalism As a result of the politicization of climate science, climate tribes (consisting of a small number of climate researchers) were established in response to the politically motivated climate disinformation machine that was associated with e.g. ExxonMobil, CEI, Inhofe/Morano etc. The reaction of the climate tribes to the political assault has been to circle the wagons and point the guns outward in an attempt to discredit misinformation from politicized advocacy groups. The motivation of scientists in the pro AGW tribes appears to be less about politics and more about professional ego and scientific integrity as their research was under assault for nonscientific reasons (I'm sure there are individual exceptions, but this is my overall perception). The need for public credibility and transparency has dramatically increased in recent years as the policy relevance of climate research has increased. The climate research enterprise has not yet adapted to this need, and our institutions need to strategize to respond to this need. --------------- Data sources In a response to this whole story......the group from RealClimate.org has now posted a page that has links to a ton raw and processed global climate data, including model codes etc..... --------------------- A heads up!

To no surprise, the month was warmer than normal, with a global temperature anomaly of +0.66 C or +1.19 F. The last time GISS had a global land/ocean temperature anomaly that was colder than normal was back in February of 1994.

Greenland from above. Image courtesy of NASA. During the period from 2006 to 2008, the ice sheet experienced an accelerated mass loss to 273 Gt per year (1 Gt is the mass of 1 cubic kilometer of water). This is equivalent to 0.75 mm of global sea level rise per year, according to the EurekAlert article. The combination between increased iceberg production, driven by acceleration of Greenland's fast-flowing outlet glaciers, and increased meltwater production at the ice sheet surface led to this mass loss. According to the report, the surface melting started to increase around 1996, but an increase in snowfall at the same rate on the ice sheet for a decade masked the surface mass losses for nearly a decade.

Maybe not as extreme as a recent Hollywood movie, but close enough, according to new research. A slowdown of the Gulf Stream led to a sudden \"Big Freeze\" across Europe about 12,800 years ago. This event was known as the Younger Dryas Mini Ice Age. Climate changes associated with the Younger Dryas, highlighted here by the light blue bar, include (from top to bottom): cooling and decreased snow accumulation in Greenland, cooling in the tropical Cariaco Basin, and warming in Antarctica. Also shown is the flux of meltwater from the Laurentide Ice Sheet down the St. Lawrence River. Image courtesy of NOAA. New Greenland ice core research from the University of Saskatchewan suggests that this mini ice age took just months, instead of a decade to take hold over Europe. Analysis of carbon and oxygen isotopes show that at the start of the Big Freeze, temperatures plummeted and lake productivity stopped within months, or a year at most. \"It would be like taking Ireland today and moving it up to Svalbard\" in the Arctic, says William Patterson, lead author of the study. The Younger Dryas mini ice age was brought about when a glacial lake covering most of north-west Canada burst its banks and poured into the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. The huge flood diluted the salinity-driven North Atlantic Ocean mega-currents, including the Gulf Stream, and stalled it. Two studies published in 2006 show that the same thing happened again 8200 years ago, when the Northern hemisphere went through another cold spell, according to the NewScientist article. Some climate scientists have suggested that the Greenland ice sheet could have the same effect if it suddenly melts through climate change, but the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded this was unlikely to happen this century.

Photo courtesy of the Accuweather.com photo gallery. According to the NASA story, there are 1.2 billion lightning flashes in the world per year. Each lightning flash produces a puff of nitrogen oxide gas that reacts with sunlight and other gases in the atmosphere to produce ozone. Near Earth's surface, ozone can harm human and plant health; higher in the atmosphere, it is a potent greenhouse gas. The image below from NASA shows the annual lightning flash density across the globe. Note the highest concentration is over central Africa. Florida also experiences a great deal of lightning. It is believed that lightning contributes about 10% of atmospheric nitrogen oxide, which is much smaller compared to fossil fuel emissions, but scientists are still not completely sure if that estimate is correct, and that it may be underdone. \"One of the things we're trying to understand is how much ozone changes caused by lightning affect radiative forcing, and how that might translate into climate impacts,\" said Kenneth Pickering, an atmospheric scientist who studies lightning at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. There's a possibility that lightning could produce a feedback cycle that accelerates global warming. \"If a warming globe creates more thunderstorms,\" Pickering noted, \"that could lead to more NOx production, which leads to more ozone, more radiative forcing, and more warming,\" Pickering emphasizes that this is a theory, and while some global modeling studies suggest this is indeed the case, it has not yet been borne out by field observations.

NCAR states that the increase in record highs has been spurred by a warming climate and that the ratio of record highs to lows will likely increase in the coming decades if greenhouse gas emissions keep climbing. Personally, I am not so sure that you can come to that conclusion so early (spurred by a warming climate) based on 10 years of data over a very small portion of the globe. They may be right, but let's see what the next 10-20 years of data brings. It was also noted in the story that most of the warming over the past decade was with nighttime temperatures, which could also be a reflection of increasing urbanization (heat island effect) across the lower 48 and more cloud cover. Right here in State College, there has clearly been a lack of record lows over the past decade and I think a part of that reason is the fact that the weather station (which has not moved) has been getting more an more surrounded by large buildings over the past 15-20 years. The tuition also keeps on rising here at PSU yet they keep building and expanding here at PSU. (Sorry, just a little rage here). Anthony Watts had a quick response to this story in his blog. It should be noted, however, according to the UCAR News story , the readings, collected at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center, undergo a quality control process at the data center that looks for such potential problems as missing data as well as inconsistent readings caused by changes in thermometers, station locations, or other factors. \"If the climate weren't changing, you would expect the number of temperature records to diminish significantly over time,\" says Claudia Tebaldi, a statistician with Climate Central who is one of the paper's co-authors. \"As you measure the high and low daily temperatures each year, it normally becomes more difficult to break a record after a number of years.

On average, the Arctic accounts for 10-15 percent of the Earth?s carbon sink, but it can vary between 0 and 25 percent, according to the USGS release. According to the researchers, climate change could alter the amount of CO2 that the Arctic traps. Climate change is occurring at about twice the rate as that in the lower latitudes, and this more rapid change could end up eliminating the sink, or even turn the Arctic into a carbon source. Warmer temperatures can accelerate the rate of surface organic matter decomposition, releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Of greater concern, says McGuire, is that the permafrost has begun to thaw, exposing previously frozen soil to decomposition and erosion. These changes could reverse the historical role of the Arctic as a sink for carbon dioxide. The thawing permafrost could also result in a more waterlogged Arctic, says McGuire, a situation that could encourage the activity of methane-producing organisms. Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas. On the flip side, global warming may produce longer growing seasons that promote plant photosynthesis, which removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Also, the expansion of shrubs in tundra and the movement of treeline northward could sequester more carbon in vegetation.

That makes sense. Weren't most of us taught by our parents to read more and watch less TV when we were growing up? Unfortunately for me and my older brother, we did not follow that advice very well. My sister on the other hand always had a book in hand. I will say that I have always been big into the newspaper, and now of course the internet is taking over that category. According to the George Mason study , people who read newspapers and use the Internet more often are more likely to be concerned about global warming and believe they are better educated about the subject. Watching more television, however, did not increase their knowledge of the subject. Unfortunately, it took a very unrealistic movie like 'The Day after Tomorrow' to advance the public's interest in this domain, according to Communication Professor Xiaoquan Zhao. Al Gore's 'Inconvenient Truth' also played in role, and as we all know, there are many mixed opinions on that movie. Also, to no surprise, Republicans are more likely to believe that scientists are still debating the existence and human causes of global warming, whereas Democrats are more likely to believe that a scientific consensus has already been achieved on these matters.

The tiles will turn white (reflecting the sun's radiation) on a hot day, but turn black (absorbing the sun's radiation) on a cold day. We have seen in the past a lot of talk about changing our roof color to more white, which would keep our houses cooler in a warming world, but what do you do in the winter when it still gets cold and you still have that white roof? It can end up canceling out the energy savings that you made in the summer. This invention solves that problem, as the tiles adapt to the changing season. The white tiles keep our houses a little cooler on those hot summer days so that we do not need to use as much AC. According to the LiveScience article that could be as much as a 20% savings in cooling costs. In the winter the black roof allows more of the sun's heat to penetrate into the house, thus allowing us to lower the setting of the thermostat a little bit. The actual amount of savings from a black roof was undetermined at this present time. This roof tile setup is still not commercial ready, but they are working on it.

The statisticians found a distinct decades-long upward trend in the numbers, but could not find a significant drop in the past 10 years in either data set, according to the AP. NOAA also re-examined their temperature data and found no cooling trend. \"The last 10 years are the warmest 10-year period of the modern record,\" said NOAA climate monitoring chief Deke Arndt. \"Even if you analyze the trend during that 10 years, the trend is actually positive, which means warming.\" John Grego, a statistician from the University of South Carolina produced three charts to show how choosing a starting date can alter perceptions.

Below, specifically note the downward trend of older ice (green). We already knew that the 2009 minimum sea ice extent in the Arctic was the 3rd lowest behind 2007 and 2008 since satellite records began in 1979. According to the NSIDC, the September Arctic sea ice minimum is now declining at a rate of 11.2% per decade, while there has been a 3% decline in the winter extent. This remains on a trend leading toward ice-free Arctic summers in the next few decades. Sea surface temperatures in the Arctic during the melt season were above normal, but slightly lower than the last two seasons. The cooler conditions, which resulted largely from cloudy skies during late summer, slowed ice loss compared to the past two years. In addition, atmospheric patterns in August and September helped to spread out the ice pack, keeping extent higher, according to EurekAlert. At the end of the summer, younger, thinner ice less than one year in age accounted for 49 percent of the ice cover, from the CU-Boulder report. Second- year ice made up 32 percent of the ice cover, compared to 21 percent in 2007 and 9 percent in 2008. Only 19% of the ice cover was over 2 years old, which is the least ever recorded since 1979. The 1981-2000 average is 48%. \"We've preserved a fair amount of first-year ice and second-year ice after this summer compared to the past couple of years,\" said NSIDC scientist Walt Meier of CU-Boulder's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences. \"If this ice remains in the Arctic thorough the winter, it will thicken, which gives some hope of stabilizing the ice cover over the next few years.

We have been talking about Arctic sea ice fairly frequently over the past couple of years, as it is a pretty good indicator of the state of the longer term global climate. We have also seen some vague predictions about what the state of the Arctic sea ice will be in the future. New research by Peter Wadhams , who is a professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge and one of the world's leading experts on sea ice cover in the Arctic states that the Arctic will indeed have ice free summers within 20 years , according to the Reuters article. According to Wadhams, most of this melting will take place within a decade, even though some experts say that global temperatures will continue to level off of fall slightly for several years before resuming a steady climb. Wadhams compared ice thickness measurements taken by a Royal Navy submarine in 2007 with evidence gathered by the British explorer Pen Hadow earlier this year. Hadow and his team on the Catlin Arctic Survey drilled 1,500 holes to gather evidence during a 280-mile walk across the Arctic. They found the average thickness of ice-floes was 1.8 meters, a depth considered too thin to survive the summer's ice melt, according to the article. \"The data supports the new consensus view -- based on seasonal variation of ice extent and thickness, changes in temperatures, winds and especially ice composition -- that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer within about 20 years, said Wadhams. -------------- Some of my own backyard weather.........

Erik Post, a biology professor from Penn State University, has spent six weeks of each of the last several summers in Greenland to study the impacts of recent climate change on the Arctic ecosystem. His research is posted in the Journal Science. Here is the link to the abstract. Post and other researchers have observed first hand how the rapid ice melt up in the Arctic has impacted a number of prominent species, according to the Centre Daily News article. Some excerpts from the Centre Daily News Article......... 1. Polar bear populations have a direct effect on human food consumption, Post explained. When polar bear numbers decrease, ring seals that the bears eat will increase. Ring seals eat cod, so an increase in seals will decrease the cod available for humans to harvest and consume. 2. \"Caribou populations are crashing,\" said Taylor Rees, a Penn State graduate who worked for six weeks with Post in Greenland. With flora becoming more abundant in the warmer Arctic climate, it creates something called \"trophic mismatch,\" she said. This occurs when the blooming season for Arctic flora arrives earlier but the calving season for caribou remains the same. Caribou calves thus miss the peak growing season, and, as a result, fewer survive. 3. Native Greenlanders have also been impacted. Many have given up hunting Caribou in some areas because it doesn't pay off as it once did. \"To me, it?s really a tragic aspect of climate change,\" said Post. Post noted that the people won?t starve, but their 4,000-year-old culture will suffer as they seek other ways of finding food. According to Rees, the world needs to learn from the Inuit, who are the indigenous people in the Arctic. They are \"not wasting time freaking out,\" they are adapting to the changes, she said.

Basically, in short, Steve McIntyre of Climate Audit, was finally able to look at the full set of Yamal (peninsula in Russia) tree ring data from Keith Briffa after years of attempted requests. Briffa's limited data was processed using a different algorithm than used by Hamtemirov and Shiyatov (H&S) for consistency with two other northern high latitude series), to create another ?Yamal? record that was designed to improve the representation of long-term climate variability, according to Real Climate. Ross McKitrick, who used to work with Steve McIntyre, recently wrote an essay about this story in the Financial Post. In his essay, McKitrick notes that when 34 up to date core samples of this this \"missing\" core data where added by McIntyre the temperature plot ended up flattening out for the 20th century and thus showed no more hockey stick. McKitrick also notes that the hockey stick shape depended on the least reliable portion of the data set. I encourage you to read both sides of the story and come to your own conclusion on this. . Links are provided below. You can find the initial post by Steve McIntyre here at Climate Audit. It is quite technical with several posts. Anthony Watts of 'Watts Up With That?' has his more simplified version right right here . Here is the Financial Post article by Ross McKitrick. Here is the response from Keith Briffa. Steve McIntyre discusses Briffa's response right here. From Real Climate......McIntyre has based his 'critique' on a test conducted by randomly adding in one set of data from another location in Yamal that he found on the internet. People have written theses about how to construct tree ring chronologies in order to avoid end-member effects and preserve as much of the climate signal as possible. Curiously no-one has ever suggested simply grabbing one set of data, deleting the trees you have a political objection to and replacing them with another set that you found lying around on the web.

Green roofs and CO2 Scientists at Michigan State University measured carbon levels in plant and soil samples collected from 13 green roofs in Michigan and Maryland over a two-year period. The researchers found that replacing traditional roofing materials with green roofs in an urban area the size of Detroit, with a population of about one million, would capture more than 55,000 tons of carbon. That is roughly similar to eliminating a year's worth of carbon dioxide emitted by 10,000 mid-sized SUVs and trucks, according to LiveScience. Other benefits of \"green roofs\" --Reduce heating and cooling costs of buildings. 10% reduction in natural gas consumption and 2% drop in electricity use in a typical building. --Retain and detain storm water. --Attract birds and wildlife, which may be good or bad, depending on the species. --Absorb noise and pollution. --\"Green roofs\" also last 2 to 3 times longer than standard roofs because they are protected from ultraviolet radiation and the extreme fluctuations in temperature that cause roof membranes to deteriorate. ------------ Brad Rowe, and environmental scientist at Michigan State University believes that the U.S. Government does not need to mandate the roofs in the future, but instead provide incentives for them, similar to policies of other countries. \"Green roofs are more expensive, but only initially.

The 2009 minimum was the 3rd lowest during the 30-year record, or about 620,000 square miles below the average minimum. Based on the chart below, it looks like the minimum was reached close to the average date for the minimum, but slightly earlier than the past few years. The minimum extent did not fall as low as the minimums of the last two years, because temperatures through the summer were relatively cooler. Winds also tended to disperse the ice pack over a larger region, according to the NSIDC. One of my readers wanted me to go back to my July 30th post about the varying predictions for the Arctic sea ice minimum that were made in July. Here is a chart that shows the various predictions. It appears that the actual minimum will be 5.10 million square kilometers. Just 3 of the predictors came within 100,000 sq. km of the actual figure, while a majority predicted there would be less sea ice extent at the September minimum. While the ice extent this year is higher than the last two years, scientists do not consider this to be a recovery. Despite conditions less favorable to ice loss, the 2009 minimum extent is still 24% below the 1979-2000 average, and 20% below the thirty-year 1979-2008 average minimum.

This is because when the climate transitions from ice age to warm age, there is a rapid increase in precipitation. But at the same time, the areas lying near the coast begin to decrease in size, because the ice is melting at the edge. When the ice melts at the edge, it slowly causes the entire ice sheet to 'collapse' and become lower.

Earth from the moon. Image courtesy of NASA. One of the world's leading climate modellers and an author of the IPCC predicts that in the next few years a natural cooling trend would dominate over warming caused by humans. The cooling would be down to cyclical changes to ocean currents and temperatures in the North Atlantic, a feature known as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). According to Mojib Latif of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences at Kiel University, Germany, cycles were probably responsible for some of the strong global warming seen in the past three decades. \"But how much? The jury is still out,\" he told 1500 of the world's top climate scientists gathering in Geneva at the UN's World Climate Conference. More and more scientists now agree that the short-term prognosis for climate change is much less certain than once thought, according to the NewScientist article . Natural variability is at least as important as the long-term climate changes from global warming. \"In many ways we know more about what will happen in the 2050s than next year,\" said Vicky Pope from the UK Met Office. Pope also noted that the dramatic Arctic Ice loss in recent summers was partly a product of natural cycles rather than global warming.

According to UK Met Office Scientists working on behalf of the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), temperatures would rise by more than 4 degrees celsius (7.2 F ) averaged over the globe by the end of this century. \"Four degrees of warming, averaged over the globe, translates into even greater warming in many regions, along with major changes in rainfall. If greenhouse gas emissions are not cut soon, we could see major climate changes within our own lifetimes,\" according to Dr Richard Betts, Head of Climate Impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre. I wonder if they considered the impact of recessions and depressions on emissions? Anyway, the greatest warming (no surprise here) would take place in the Arctic with warming up to 15.2 C (27 F) for a high-emissions scenario, enhanced by melting of snow and ice causing more of the Sun?s radiation to be absorbed (positive feedback). Large parts of Africa could warm by as much as 10 C (18 F) by the end of the century along with a significant decrease in rainfall. Based on their map below, it looks like most of the continental U.S. would see a temperature increase anywhere between 6 and 9 C ( 11 to 16 F) by the end of the century under this worst case scenario.

Here is the question...... If the total energy that reaches Earth from the Sun varies by only 0.1 percent across the approximately 11-year solar cycle, how can such a small variation drive major changes in weather patterns on Earth? Here is what they found..... Chemicals in the stratosphere and sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean respond during solar maximum in a way that amplifies the Sun's influence on some aspects of air movement. This can intensify winds and rainfall, change sea surface temperatures and cloud cover over certain tropical and subtropical regions, and ultimately influence global weather. An example of an active sun, loaded with spots . The most recent look at the sun. No spots! Excerpts from the article........ One example was that the sun, the stratosphere and the oceans are connected in ways that can influence events such as winter rainfall in North America,\" says NCAR scientist Gerald Meehl, the lead author. The slight increase in solar energy during the peak production of sunspots is absorbed by stratospheric ozone. The energy warms the air in the stratosphere over the tropics, where sunlight is most intense, while also stimulating the production of additional ozone there that absorbs even more solar energy. Since the stratosphere warms unevenly, with the most pronounced warming occurring at lower latitudes, stratospheric winds are altered and, through a chain of interconnected processes, end up strengthening tropical precipitation. Earth's response to the solar cycle continues for a year or two following peak sunspot activity. The La Nina-like pattern triggered by the solar maximum tends to evolve into a pattern similar to El Nino as slow-moving currents replace the cool water over the eastern tropical Pacific with warmer water. The ocean response is only about half as strong as with El Nino and the lagged warmth is not as consistent as the La Nina-like pattern that occurs during peaks in the solar cycle. The solar maximum could potentially enhance a true La Nina event or dampen a true El Nino event. The La Nina of 1988-89 occurred near the peak of solar maximum. That La Nina became unusually strong and was associated with significant changes in weather patterns, such as an unusually mild and dry winter in the southwestern United States.

Sunset over the Arctic. This reversal has supposedly raised Arctic summer temperatures to their highest levels for at least 2000 years, according to a report that was posted in the Journal Science. The rise in temperature began around 1900 and accelerated after 1950. Professor Darrell Kaufman, a climate scientist at Northern Arizona University and lead author of the study, along with his colleagues reconstructed a decade-by-decade record of the Arctic climate over the past 2,000 years by analyzing lake sediments, ice cores and tree rings. Computer simulations of changes in seasonal sunlight levels caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit and the shifting tilt of its axis verified the long-term cooling trend.

It also looks like the 2009 minimum will even be higher than last year's minimum, but not by much. Check out the latest chart below, courtesy of the national Snow and Ice Data Center. According to the NSIDC, the decrease in sea ice in the Arctic Basin slowed significantly during the first two weeks of August due to natural changes in the atmospheric circulation pattern over the Arctic. Early in the summer, the circulation pattern promoted winds that helped push ice out of the Siberian coastal seas, and also brought clear skies and warm temperatures that helped induce melt. By late July the pattern started to change and led to winds that redirected the motion of the ice cover, pushing the ice edge outward toward the Siberian coast and discouraging ice from exiting the Arctic Ocean through Fram Strait. --------------- One question I hear from time to time.......... Why don?t we hear much about Antarctic sea ice? Thanks to the NSIDC, here is the answer............ NSIDC scientists do monitor sea ice in the Antarctic, and sea ice in the Antarctic is of interest to scientists worldwide. While many have published peer-reviewed journal articles on the topic, it has received less attention than the Arctic. There are several reasons for this. Unlike Arctic sea ice, Antarctic sea ice disappears almost completely during the summer, and has since scientists have studied it. Earth?s climate system over thousands of years has been \"in tune\" with this annual summertime disappearance of Antarctic sea ice. However, satellite records and pre-satellite records indicate that the Arctic has not been free of summertime sea ice for at least 5,500 years and possibly for 125,000 years. So Earth?s climate system and ecosystems, as they exist today, did not develop in conjunction with an ice-free Arctic. Such an ice-free Arctic summer environment would be a change unprecedented in modern human history and could have ramifications for climate around the world.

Joe responds to a Greenpeace statement that says that the wildfires in California are spreading faster due to climate change. You can watch the interview right here. Courtesy of YouTube. Joe also has a comment for our Accuweather.com viewers below that he wanted me to share with you......... An open letter to Accuweather.com viewers from Accuweather.com's tropical and long range weather expert Joe Bastardi. My appearance on Bill O'Reilly brought up some things that seem to be a shock to people, but to many many people that are looking hard at the weather, are not. Please remember that I am not, nor do I seek, to be a spokesman on the AGW issue. I will however take a stand when called upon, on what I believe to be true. I have always had an open mind on man's input into the climate system. However because I have to be acquainted with long term patterns of changing weather, which is what climate is for any one site, I need to know where we stand against the course of history. Because of that, I have to be acquainted with the global warming issue in much more than a casual way. It is to my advantage as the chief long range and hurricane forecaster here to develop a working knowledge of where we are and where we are going in the overall global pattern. To be sure, the cooling now is happening faster than it should because it got so warm in the first place via the super nino of 97-98. The last warm cycle reached its peak in the late 50s when we actually surfaced submarines at the north pole in 1959... IN MARCH! I often wonder what global temps would have been measured at then if we had the ways of measuring we do now. The fact that there was so much \"shock\" at some of the revelations that showed up on the O'Reilly Factor is because people are refusing to understand that so far, this has been a case of been there, done that. One can pull out as many cases of bad weather in the 30s, 40s and 50s as they can now. I still believe the 3 greatest examples of how bad a hurricane can get in relation to latitude are the 1938 hurricane with 186 mph wind gusts at Blue Hill Mass, the 1944 hurricane that destroyed the Atlantic City boardwalk, and Hurricane Donna which gave hurricane force winds to every state from Florida to Maine. The 1944 hurricane had winds 600 miles in diameter and stripped 50% of the screws from a recon plane into it. Unlike many people, I am well acquainted and respect the co2 warming idea, but in its pure form, which actually allows for the cooling coming now! There in lies the problem. We can't know till after the period that is coming up through 2030 whether co2 is really a player or not. The threat of not only oceanic cycles cooling the earth, but the suns lack of intensity and increased volcanic and seismic activity could mean that as some papers in the early 90s (and dismissed by many) opined we would be as cold as back in the early 1800s. What you see now may just be the beginning. One thing we do know, that we should be skeptical of any future event, no matter what we believe. I will leave you with this. Common sense dictates that a trace gas needed for life on the planet would not be the cause for destroying life on the planet. Common sense dictates that what has happened before without man can happen again with man. Common sense would dictate that you not believe me, or any one else, but go look for YOURSELF. If its important enough for you to be happy with what I said, or to be mad as all get out at what I said, you owe it to yourself to go read all sides of the argument. To be informed, and not to simply throw stones. In the end, for me its all about getting the weather right. 1 day, 1 week 1 year or whatever. That is the bottom line. What I opine about global warming is not because this is my goal...to be in this debate, it's a by product of the work I put in to do what I was made to do..forecast the weather. But I will not run, nor bow down to people who simply wish to destroy the chance to get the right answer in this debate, for IT IS ABOUT THE WEATHER! it's that simple. I do not seek to be a spokesman, but my company believes in freedom of speech. Please remember my opinion is my own, but perhaps the reason for my successes in this field are because of the countless hours I spend that no one but me and the good lord above sees in preparing to answer the call. That call comes every day in my forecasts, but if it comes in this matter, I will not back down from what I have prepared myself for.

The thin, straight cloud lines might be trans-Atlantic aircraft contrails. \"Marine snow\", is actually the shells and excretions of phytoplankton that sink down from the ocean surface. Ocean creatures below the ocean surface consume the \"snow\", which then recycle up to 90% of the carbon back into the water as carbon dioxide (CO2). Most of the recycling happens in the first 689 feet (210 meters) below the ocean surface, according to the Discovery News article But, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Geoscience, if that depth sank just another 79 feet or 24 meters, it would be able to remove up to 27 PPM more CO2 from the atmosphere. \"That's not very big -- natural variability of that depth is several hundred meters,\" according to Ken Buesseler of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, who was not involved with the study. The reason why a slight change in depth would reduce atmospheric CO2 is that the deeper the snow falls into the ocean without being eaten, the more carbon-rich snow reaches the ocean floor. Once it is eaten, it becomes dissolved CO2, and it's just a matter of a short time (months to years instead of tens of thousands of years for the snow) before it makes its way back into the atmosphere. But, many scientists predict that ocean warming will raise the depth at which most carbon cycles back into the water. If that happens, the seas will hasten global warming as they spew CO2 back out into the air.

In particular, the scientists were looking at the thickness of the ice and trying to determine the longer term changes that have been going on. Satellites have only monitored sea ice extent since 1973. NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) has been on the task since 2003, allowing researchers to estimate ice thickness as well, according to the NASA article. In order to extend that record, the research team recently combined the high spatial coverage from satellites with a longer record from Cold War submarines to piece together a history of ice thickness that spans close to 50 years. In total, declassified submarine data span nearly five decades--from 1958 to 200--and cover a study area of more than 1 million square miles, or close to 40 percent of the Arctic Ocean. Their analysis shows that the Arctic Sea Ice thickness has declined 53% since a peak in 1980. Also, the current thinning of Arctic sea ice has actually been going on for quite some time.

Reply: No doubt, the 1990s and a good chunk of this decade have been active, but the most active in 1,000 years?

That medieval period of enhancement was perhaps even more active than what we have seen over the past couple of decades. \"We are at levels now that are about as high as anything we have seen in the past 1,000 years,\" said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University and the lead author of the paper. \"Hurricane activity since the mid-1990s is the highest in the historical record, but that only goes back a little more than a century and is most accurate since the advent of air travel and satellites in recent decades,\" said Mann. \"It is therefore difficult to assess if the recent increase in hurricane activity is in fact unusual.\" According to the EurekAlert release , the study also adds validity to the theory that two factors fuel higher hurricane activity, namely the La Nina effect and high surface temperatures over the ocean. If climate change continues to warm ocean waters, Mann said, it could lead to more active hurricane seasons. You can read a more detailed look at the study right here. The National Science Foundation (NSF) also interviewed Dr. Mann about the results of this study. You can watch that video here. ------------------- Our own Hurricane expert Joe Bastardi disagrees with Mann on this........... What is it with Dr. Michael Mann? His latest \"findings\" on hurricanes , that we are at some mythical high is nonsense. And if he understood how the energy budget actually worked, he should be making the argument that the low we are in is more of support of his argument of warming... fake as it is, as it would mean a distortion of the energy budget of the earth because of warming in coldest places. Again using the absolute temp of the earth is not the way to look at this, its to look at the measure of energy of the earth, and understanding that a 1 degree drop where the wet bulb is 80 is equal in energy consideration to a 32 degree rise where its -30 degrees. So Dr Mann, you should be using the record LOW ACTIVITY for your argument, except that of course would run into the true argument as to what cyclones represent..energy, in which case it falls apart. http://www.coaps.fsu.edu/~maue/tropical/global_running_ace2.jpg (From his Accuweather.com Professional column) ------------------------- Chris Landsea via the Houston Chronicle...... \"The paper comes to very erroneous conclusions because of using improper data and illogical techniques,\" said Chris Landsea, science and operations officer at the National Hurricane Center. In his criticism, Landsea notes that the paper begins by saying that Atlantic tropical activity has \"reached anomalous levels over the past decade.\" This ignores recent work by Landsea and a number of other hurricane scientists who found that storm counts in the early 1900's -- in an era without satellites and fewer seaborne observers -- likely missed three or four storms a year. The addition of these storms to the historical record, he said, causes the long-term trend over the last century to disappear. \"This isn't a small quibble,\"he said. \"It's the difference between a massive trend with doubling in the last 100 years, versus no trend.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"15540a7ee067b5d9ea744844d5b2bf2456d891d1"}

The research team's results were clear and consistent in showing an increase in these events outside of the tropics. Within the tropics, the results were conflicting, most likely due to the fact that the typical rainfall producers in the tropics were too small scale for the current model simulations. Higher resolution models are needed instead. Model simulations during this study also showed that precipitation in extreme events will go up by about 6 percent for every one degree Celsius increase in temperature, according to the EurekAlert release . The basic underlying reason for the projected increase in precipitation is that warmer air can hold more water vapor. So as the climate heats up, \"there will be more vapor in the atmosphere, which will lead to an increase in precipitation extremes,\" according to lead author Paul O'Gorman of MIT. But, extreme events do not increase at the same rate as the moisture capacity of the atmosphere. The extremes do go up, but not by as much as the total water vapor, O'Gorman says. That is because water condenses out as rising air cools, but the rate of cooling for the rising air is less in a warmer climate, and this moderates the increase in precipitation.

Image courtesy of Wikipedia. The research team, led by Russel Drysdale, suggest that the Earth emerges from ice ages due in large part to changes in the tilt of the planet in relation to the sun, otherwise known as its obliquity . This affects the total amount of sunlight each hemisphere receives in its respective summer, rather than the peak intensity of the solar radiation during the northern summer, according to the Discovery News. The team studied sediment on the sea floor and compared the changes in the sea floor to similar material on the surface that can be accurately dated through samples taken from cave stalagmites. The result is that the new date for the end of the second last ice age is thousands of years too early to be related to any increase in the intensity of the northern hemisphere summer as predicted by the Milankovitch Theory. Instead, the researchers found that, in the past million years global warming events have occurred every second or third cycle of the Earth's changing obliquity, which occurs every 41,000 years.

The cumulative net balance is the total loss or gain of glacier mass since the beginning of the study period. The three glaciers, which are the South Cascade Glacier in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State; Wolverine Glacier on the Kenai Peninsula near Anchorage, Alaska; and Gulkana Glacier in the interior of Alaska have lost mass since the United States Geological Survey (USGS) began monitoring them more than 4 decades ago, but the rate of decline has steadily increased over the past two decades.

In terms of global warming opinion, the pair present a list of four characteristic beliefs of nature by combining four possible myths of nature with four myths of human nature. From this framework, Maslin says we can tell which person is likely to believe which view of nature. 1. Nature is benign. 2. Nature is ephemeral. 3. Nature is tolerant. 4.Nature is capricious.

For each day that the high temperature in your hometown is at least 1 degree Fahrenheit above average, as listed by Weather Underground, you owe me $25. For each day that it is at least 1 degree Fahrenheit below average, I owe you $25. 2. The challenge proceeds in monthly intervals, with the first month being August. At the end of each month, we'll tally up the winning and losing days and the loser writes the winner a check for the balance. 3. The challenge automatically rolls over to the next month until/unless: (i) one party informs the other by the 20th of the previous month that he would like to discontinue the challenge (that is, if you want to discontinue the challenge for September, you'd have to tell me this by August 20th), or (ii) the losing party has failed to pay the winning party in a timely fashion, in which case the challenge may be canceled at the sole discretion of the winning party. --------- All I can say is that I wish I had seen this bet beforehand. I know there would be several of us at Accuweather.com who would take the challenge. I personally do not bet, but if I did, I think this is one bet that I could very well end up on the positive $$$ end. I wonder if Joe Bastardi saw this? He would jump on this challenge in a second! Long range computer models going out a month in advance are pretty good now, especially when we are talking temperature departures. In this case, we would look at August. If I was going to bet, I would probably pick a city in Minnesota, Wisconsin, or Michigan for the month of August. Silver better hope that he had some takers pick Seattle, Portland, OR or Boise, as that part of the country should continue to see very warm August compared to normal.

According to the Rice University press release , climate models explain only about half of the heating during a well-documented period of rapid global warming in Earth's ancient past. We are talking the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum (55 million years ago), or PETM, which is probably the best ancient climate analogue for present-day earth. \"In a nutshell, theoretical models cannot explain what we observe in the geological record,\" said oceanographer Gerald Dickens, a co-author of the study and professor of Earth science at Rice University. \"There appears to be something fundamentally wrong with the way temperature and carbon are linked in climate models.\" Based on data from core samples drilled from the deep seafloor over the past two decades, Dickens and colleagues conclude that something other than carbon dioxide (CO2) caused much of the heating during the PETM. \"Some feedback loop or other processes that aren't accounted for in these models -- the same ones used by the IPCC for current best estimates of 21st Century warming -- caused a substantial portion of the warming that occurred during the PETM.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"0dc789b5b31dd52f57cc611f20123f5a5063e291"}

According to the report, the Southern Oscillation is a key indicator of changing global atmospheric temperatures 7 months later. Lead author John McLean of the Australian Climate Science Coalition said that when climate modelers could not accurately determine historical temperatures \"they added a 'human influence' to their models\". \"This paper shows that the missing component was the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO),\" Mr McLean said in the Farm Weekly article. Also from the article.......... The group says that the surge in global temperatures since 1977 can be attributed to a 1976 climate shift in the Pacific Ocean that made warming El Nino conditions more likely than they were over the previous 30 years and cooling La Nina conditions less likely. \"We have shown that internal global climate-system variability accounts for at least 70 per cent of the observed global climate variation over the past half-century,\" Associate Professor de Freitas said. The groups says it is also well known that volcanic activity has a cooling influence, and as is well documented by the effects of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption. \"The close relationship between the Southern Oscillation and mean global temperature, as described in the paper, suggests future global temperatures will continue to change primarily in response to ENSO cycling, volcanic activity and solar changes,\" Prof. Carter said. This month, NOAA announced that El Nino conditions had returned to the equatorial Pacific. --------------------------- Professor David Karoly of the University of Melbourne and a lead author on two of the IPCC reports questions the above study in an article from the Farmonline .......... \"The analysis method used in this paper specifically removes any long-term variations in global mean temperature and in the SOI, and only assesses the year-to-year variations. It then finds that the SOI can explain 70 per cent of the year-to-year variations in global mean temperature after ignoring the effect of volcanoes. \"Using these methods, the paper is unable to make any assessment of the effect of the SOI on long term trends in global mean temperature.\" That effect, in Prof. Karoly's opinion, is \"very small\". He also takes exception with the authors' claim that the effects of ENSO are not factored into the global climate models.

The results of the study show that maximum solar activity (high # of sunspots) and its aftermath have impacts on earth that resemble La Nina and El Nino events in the tropical Pacific Ocean, even though the total energy reaching the earth from the sun varies by only 0.1 percent across the solar cycle. The new paper, along with an earlier one by Meehl and colleagues, shows that as the Sun reaches maximum activity, it heats cloud-free parts of the Pacific Ocean enough to increase evaporation, intensify tropical rainfall and the trade winds, and cool the eastern tropical Pacific. The result of this chain of events is similar to a La Nina event, although the cooling of about 1-2 degrees Fahrenheit is focused further east and is only about half as strong as for a typical La Nina. Over the following year or two, the La Nina-like pattern triggered by the solar maximum tends to evolve into an El Nino-like pattern, as slow-moving currents replace the cool water over the eastern tropical Pacific with warmer-than-usual water. Again, the ocean response is only about half as strong as with El Nino, according to the EurekAlert release . The research team also found that the solar-driven La Nina tends to cause relatively warm and dry conditions across parts of western North America. --------------- Here is the link to the study abstract.

The article discusses the example of negative climate feedback at work. As atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels have dropped during periods over the past 20 or so million years there was a limit to how far those levels would drop. What caused the CO2 to level off each time and prevent the earth from completely freezing over? According to Mark Pagani of Yale University, the answer is plants. Using computer models to simulate the sensitivity of vegetation to atmospheric CO2 levels and climate, the research team found that as the atmospheric CO2 concentration dropped to about 200 ppm the plants started to starve and suffocate. Trees play an important role in the sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in magnesium and calcium carbonate rocks. As mountains grow, rocks break down and become transported to the foothills, where trees hold them in place in the soil and break them down into minerals. Without the trees and plants, the weathered rocks were unable sequester atmospheric CO2 and turn into carbonates, thus allowing CO2 levels to rise again each time and prevent a full scale icehouse.

This is the first basin-wide estimate of the thickness and volume of the Arctic Ocean's ice cover. A visualization of the thinning of the Arctic sea ice from 2004 to 2008.

Winter 2004 Winter 2005 Winter 2006 Winter 2007 Winter 2008 According to the report, Arctic sea ice thinned about 0.17 meters or 7 inches a year or 2.2 feet over the 4 winters. Seasonal ice is thinner (about 6 feet on average), and much more vulnerable to melt each summer compared to the multi-year ice, which averages 9 feet in thickness and survives over one or more summers. Thicker, multi-year ice saw its areal coverage shrink by 42% over the study period. Previously, scientists relied only on measurements of area to determine how much of the Arctic Ocean is covered in ice, but ICESAT makes it possible to monitor ice thickness and volume changes over the entire Arctic Ocean for the first time. The results give scientists a better understanding of the regional distribution of ice and provide better insight into what is happening in the Arctic.

Thompson has been very active over the years in collecting ice samples from glaciers on top of mountain peaks. This is a picture I took back in early July of 2005 of the glaciers covering Mt. McKinley in Alaska. We were very fortunate to get a clear day. The mountain is often shrouded in clouds about 85% of the time in the warmer months. Some notable parts from the interview........ Radioactive layers of ice from the 1950's and 1960's are no longer present within the high glaciers of the southwestern Himalayas, which tells us that the high glaciers are being decapitated, or thinning from the top down. This is in addition to the more common retreat up the mountain slopes. The is a similar situation on Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa. Kilimanjaro has lost 3 meters (over 9 feet) of ice since 2000, according to Thompson. Once a glacier melts, the history it contained is gone forever, so there's an urgency in trying to collect the records before they are lost. The loss of tropical glaciers is very telling because they're in such sensitive places. Half of the surface of the planet lies between 30° N and 30° S. That's where the heat that drives the climate system is received. It's also where 70 per cent of the 6.7 billion people on the planet live.

The strong El Nino event of 1997/1998. The image below shows the bright red band of color over the equatorial Pacific (left side) in December 1997, which indicates well above-normal sea surface temperatures. \"Normally, El Nino results in diminished hurricanes in the Atlantic, but this new type is resulting in a greater number of hurricanes with greater frequency and more potential to make landfall,\" said Peter Webster, professor at Georgia Tech's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, in the release from EurekAlert. This new version of El Nino is being called El Nino Modoki, which in Japanese means similar, but different. A typical El Nino forms in the eastern, equatorial Pacific, while the Modoki version forms in the central Pacific. This warming in the Central Pacific is associated with a higher storm frequency and a greater potential for making landfall along the Gulf coast and the coast of Central America. According to the study, El Nino Modoki is more predictable than a typical El Nino, which as we have seen, can be quite a challenge to predict. Why is El Nino changing form to El Nino Modoki? It could be due to a natural oscillation of El Nino or it could be El Nino's response to a warming atmosphere, according to the researchers. Also from the report, it appears that La Nina may be changing its structure as well. Speaking of El Nino, it looks like we are trending toward a new El Nino as of now, with full El Nino conditions expected by the fall.

NOAA states that the only published, peer-reviewed study on this topic found that there was no bias in long-term temperature trends when they compared stations with poor siting with those that have good siting. Actually, to my surprise, the study found that stations with poor siting showed less warming. The reasons for that are well explained in the third paragraph of the memo.

According to the memo, only 70 of those stations so far have been classified as good or best by Surfacestations.org.

According to the NIPCC, there is clear and compelling evidence that higher levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), even if accompanied by higher temperatures and changes in precipitation, would, on balance, be more beneficial than harmful. Highlights from the NIPCC report.............. 1. The IPCC's (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) estimate of future man-made CO2 emissions are too high . ---There are basic errors in economics and the handling of economic statistics in the IPCC modeling. ---The IPCC grossly exaggerates the long-term increase in emissions from poor countries, and the idea that poor countries would grow so fast is implausible. 2. Higher concentrations of CO2 would be beneficial to plant and animal life. --Higher CO2 concentrations allow plants to grow bigger and produce more flowers and fruit. --Higher CO2 concentrations lead to reduced rates of water loss by transpiration, thus, plants are able to better withstand drought. --Higher CO2 concentrations allow plants to better cope with a variety of environmental stresses. --The NIPCC claims that increases in CO2 does not harm coral reefs, in fact, in the Great Barrier Reef the \"20th century witnessed the second highest period of above-average calcification in the past 237 years. 3. Higher CO2 concentrations are not responsible for weather extremes, storms or hurricanes. --The report shows that there is no evidence, at least in the U.S., that extreme high temperatures are on the increase. --Recent European heatwaves have been caused by circulation anomalies. --A warmer climate would lead to increased vertical wind shear, which would impede the development of hurricanes. --In regards to mid-latitude storms, global warming will lead to a lessening of temperature gradients between the equator and the poles. The result would be fewer and less intense storms. So, based on these conclusions from the NIPCC, should we have nothing to worry about in terms of increasing CO2 emissions? -------- The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"9c04efcd12e14f84792c3ce3eb554c39b99f7bb3"}

A high resolution satellite image of the southern Greenland ice sheet from 2006, courtesy of NASA's MODIS division. According to the study, which was highlighted in ScienceDaily, the paleoclimatologists conclude through this evidence that modern glaciers, such as those making up the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which have a similar makeup to the prehistoric sample, are just as capable of undergoing periods of rapid retreat or shrinkage, which would result in sharply rising global sea levels that would threaten large coastal populations. The samples provided the researchers with climate data over a period from 20,000 years ago to about 5,000 years ago, a period when significant warming occurred, according to ScienceDaily. \"Even though the ice sheet retreat was ongoing throughout that whole period, the lion's share of the retreat occurred in a geologic instant -- probably within as little as a few hundred years,\" said Dr. Jason Briner, lead author of the study.

Particulate pollution in itself, is thought to be holding climate change in check, as it causes sunlight to be reflected. Particulate pollution off the Northeast coast. Image courtesy of NASA. Researchers measured atmospheric aerosols over Riverside, California and Mexico City. Using an instrument that measures the size, chemical composition and optical properties of aerosols in real time, they showed that jagged bits of fresh soot quickly become coated with a spherical shell of other chemicals, particularly sulfate, nitrate, and organic carbon, through light-driven chemical reactions, according to the University of California news article. \"The coating acts like a lens and focuses the light into the center of the particle, enhancing warming,\" Prather said. \"Many people think sulfate aerosols are a good thing because they are highly reflective and cool our planet. However we are seeing that sulfate is commonly mixed with soot in the same particles, which means in some regions sulfate could lead to more warming, as opposed to more cooling as one would expect for a pure sulfate aerosol.?

The zone, on average, has been moving northward at just less than 1 mile a year. A satellite view of the ITCZ. Note the clusters of broken clouds aligned just north of the equator (central/eastern Pacific region) in this image. Courtesy of NASA. The ITCZ normally fluctuates between 3 and 10 degrees north of the equator, depending on the time of the year. Researchers believe that global warming is probably the reason for this northward trend. The ITCZ is indicated by the band of heavy precipitation (blue/purple colors) over the Pacific. Image courtesy of the University of Washington. The new article presents surprising evidence that the intertropical convergence zone hugged the equator some 3 1/2 centuries ago during Earth's little ice age, which lasted from 1400 to 1850, according to the EurekAlert press release. Sediment cores from Palau, which lies about 7 degrees north of the equator and in the heart of the modern convergence zone, also revealed arid conditions during the little ice age. In contrast, the researchers present evidence that the Galapagos Islands, today an arid place on the equator in the Eastern Pacific, had a wet climate during the little ice age. \"If the intertropical convergence zone was 550 kilometers, or 5 degrees, south of its present position as recently as 1630, it must have migrated north at an average rate of 1.4 kilometers - just less than a mile - a year,\" according to Julian Sachs, associate professor of oceanography at the University of Washington and lead author of the paper. \"Were that rate to continue, the intertropical convergence zone will be 126 kilometers - or more than 75 miles - north of its current position by the latter part of this century.\" If the band continues to migrate at just less than a mile (1.4 kilometers) a year, which is the average for all the years it has been moving north, then some Pacific islands near the equator - even those that currently enjoy abundant rainfall - may be drier within decades and starved of freshwater by mid-century or sooner, according to the EurekAlert report.

I hope you have are having or had a great holiday weekend... depending on when you read this obviously. I am not very politically active or savvy, but I came across this article and thought that you might find this article interesting and have an opinion to share about it. This article gives me hope that people and the politicians that represent them in both federal and state governments are taking the threat of global warming seriously. However, I also find this article slightly disappointing, since all that these \"Auto Emission Standards\" do is regulate miles per gallon of gasoline that a vehicle needs to meet. Nothing is governed about what can come out of their tailpipes, or, better yet, researching about alternate energy forms that may be able to power our cars that we drive. It almost seems to me that government has given up weaning the public off of fossil fuels and resigned itself to the fact that motor vehicles will continue to be powered by fossil fuels, at least in the immediate future. In my opinion, this really does nothing but prolong the buildup of greenhouse gases, most noticeably carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. If a real dent in the problem of global warming is intended, I think we need to look at and invest in alternate fuel sources for our motor vehicles, hopefully so that the output of greenhouse gases by motor vehicles is drastically cut or stopped entirely. I know that there is a fine line between economic feasibility and environmental needs, and generally the all mighty dollar will win. That is the way of this world, especially with how poor the economy is right now. Why invest in something that is in the future, won't affect us tomorrow, and might not even happen at all? That question is probably most peoples' opinion. Even though this approach, in my humble opinion, is short sighted and selfish , I can understand it. Not saying I agree with it, but I comprehend it.

The report stated that climate models are not reliable. According to the report, the NIPCC states that climate models do not represent reality and that groups such as the IPCC are treating them as if they do. Some of the main points from this chapter........ 1. Computer models do not consider solar dimming and brightening. The models also fail to account the existence of water vapor 'dimers' and their atmospheric absorption of incoming solar radiation in the near-infrared which may lead to a negative feedback. Water vapor is by far the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. 2. Computer models do not accurately model the role of clouds. 3. Computer models do not explain many features of the Earth's observed climate. -- Models overestimate the amount of solar radiation striking the surface. --Climate models do not explain the many oscillations such as the NAO, AMO and PDO. Including the ENSO phases. --Climate models are poor in predicting precipitation. This is also true with short weather forecasting models, just ask a number of seasoned forecasters here at AW. 4. Climate models are inadequate when it comes to simulating or projecting regional effects. Hard to argue that, as the resolution of many of these models is quite low. ---------- In conclusion, the NIPCC states that climate models should not be used in formulating government policy.

A professor from Concordia University's Department of Geography, Planning and Environment, along with colleagues from Victoria and the U.K. have found a direct relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and global warming. The team, lead by Damon Matthews, used a combination of global climate models and historical climate data to show that there is a simple linear relationship between total cumulative emissions and global temperature change, according to the Concordia University press release. Matthews and his colleagues show that each emission of carbon dioxide results in the same global temperature increase, regardless of when or over what period of time the emission occurs. For every tonne of CO2 that is emitted there will be an increase of 0.0000000000015 degrees of global temperature change. A look at CO2 emissions across the world (2006 data). Image courtesy of Wikipedia. The gas composition of the earth's atmosphere. Image courtesy Wikipedia.

In my original email to Dr. Matthews I asked him the following questions about the following statement that was in the press release....... Matthews and colleagues show that despite these uncertainties, each emission of carbon dioxide results in the same global temperature increase, regardless of when or over what period of time the emission occurs. Is this true even when we factor in significant changes in the ENSO and the sun. How about large volcanic eruptions? Some of our commentators on this blog stated that if this is all true, then why have global temperatures leveled out or slightly cooled over the past couple of years? Response from Dr. Matthews......... The issue here is that of course CO2 is not the only thing that affect temperature. So the relationship between CO2 emissions and climate will of course be modulated by other things going on (such as the ones you mentioned) ... but we are claiming that the *CO2-induced* warming is always about the same. The issue of the last few years is also unrelated -- there are always ups and downs in temperature due to internal climate variability. These ups and downs are superimposed upon a slow upward trend due to CO2 emissions, and do not contradict our results in the least. ----------------- I read the study, but it is quite technical and at times hard to understand (at least from my stand point).

According to the results from the study, peak CO2 levels over the last 2.1 million years averaged only 280 parts per million (ppm), but today, that number is now up to 385 ppm. These results also tell scientists that they will have to look farther back (beyond 2.1 million years ago) to find an analog to modern day CO2 induced climate change. This is also the latest report to rule out a drop in CO2 as the cause for earth's ice ages growing longer and more intense some 850,000 years ago since CO2 levels were relatively flat during that period. But it also confirms many researchers' suspicion that higher carbon dioxide levels coincided with warmer intervals during the study period, according to the EurekAlert article.

The report, which is titled 'Global Climate Change Impacts in the U.S.' was put together by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. According to the site, this is the first report in a decade to break down climate change impacts by U.S. region and economic sector. Below is the official letter from the U.S. Global Change Research Program to the President and members of Congress. This new report compiles years of scientific research and takes into account new data not available during the preparation of previous large national and global assessments. It was produced by a consortium of experts from 13 U.S. government science agencies and from several major universities and research institutes. Here is a short break down of the key findings from the report......... Global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced. Human \"fingerprints\" also have been identified in many other aspects of the climate system, including changes in ocean heat content, precipitation, atmospheric moisture, and Arctic sea ice. Global warming is already or predicted to have the following impacts on the United States....... --More intense and frequent heat waves. --An increase in heavy downpours (flooding). --Reduced summer runoff, especially in the western U.S. --Rising ocean temperatures and acidification threaten coral reefs. --Increasing insect infestations and wildfires. --More frequent and severe coastal flooding due to rising sea levels. The report also focuses on climate change mitigation (measures we take to limit climate change) and adaptation. Here is a video of the press conference, courtesy of Youtube. For more information on this report, you can visit the U.S. Global Change Research Program website . You can read and download the entire report right here.

One is a large and active solar prominence has developed on the northeastern limb of the sun. It is mentioned that if you have a solar telescope, this feature can be seen. -This website also mentions how unusually far south the aurora (northern lights) descended. Pretty interesting to see the northern lights this active. -Check out this website that shows us how deep and quiet the current minima actually is.

Usually, when most people see the words global warming and tropical cyclones put together, they think about the influences (or lack of) of global warming on tropical cyclones, and not the other way around. In this new study from Harvard University, we read about the possible influence of tropical cyclones on climate. Using 23 years of infrared satellite imagery, global tropical cyclone best-track data, and reanalysis of tropopause temperature, the authors found that tropical cyclones contribute a disproportionate amount of the tropical deep convection that overshoots the troposphere and reaches the stratosphere, according to the ScienceDaily article . Diagram of the hurricane eyewall. The authors of the study found that tropical cyclones contribute 7% of deep convection in the tropics, but that 15% of that convection reaches the statosphere . Based on this information, the research team concluded that tropical cyclones could play a key role in adding water vapor (the most widespread greenhouse gas) to the stratosphere, which has shown to increase surface temperature. This leads them to conclude that there is the possibility of a positive feedback between tropical cyclones and global warming.

The opening paragraphs of Weinstein's paper are straight forward and well explained for the most part. Weinstein then lists six of the main predictions of man-made global warming models and then tries to show you why each one of those predictions is wrong. Weinstein makes some strong points, but he also seems to be doing some cherry-picking as well. Let's take a look.......... 1. While global atmospheric CO2 has indeed seen its steepest increase since 1940, it was already sharply increasing since the 1850's (industrial revolution). The atmospheric CO2 levels between 1940 and 1970 do not even compare (much lower) to what they are predicted to be from 2010 to 2100. Perhaps the modeling expects that these much higher levels of atmospheric CO2 in the future will be high enough to completely overwhelm natural climate cooling variables such as aerosols, la Nina, changes in the sun etc..... Weinstein also states.... It is also true that the present temperature trend is down and expected to continue downward for several more years before reversing again. What is his version of the present trend? This past year, past 5 years, 10 years? Also, some sources do predict a downward or stable trend for several years, while other sources disagree. 2. Weinstein states......The drop in temperature from 1940 to 1970 was claimed to have been caused by \"global dimming\" caused by aerosols made by human activity. This was stated as dominating the AGW effects at that time. This was supposed to have been overcome by activity initiated by the clean air act. In fact, the ?global dimming? continued into the mid 1990?s and then only reduced slightly before increasing more (probably due to China and other countries increased activity). If the global dimming was not significantly reduced, why did the temperature increase from 1970 to just past 2000? Weinstein seems to have forgotten about Mt. Pinatubo. Look at the chart below, courtesy of NASA, which plots global dimming aerosols. There was plenty of global dimming in the early 90s due to that volcano, but if you take out that volcano, then you can see there has been a steady decrease in global dimming aerosols from the 1980's through 2005. 3. Weinstein states......Claim 4 implies that the higher latitudes should heat up more than lower latitudes. In fact, the higher latitudes have warmed, but at a rate close to the rest of the world. A rate close to the rest of the world? Not according to the RSS microwave satellite measurements. Check this out......... His statement seems true in regards to the southern high latitudes since the 1980s, but it is clear that the northern high latitudes have warmed much more than the rest of the world since the mid 1990's. The far greater sea-surface area in the southern latitudes probably has a lot to do with the much more stable temperature anomaly trend down there, compared to the north. 4. Weinstein states.....In fact, Antarctica has overall cooled in the last 50 years except for the small tail that sticks out. Not according to this research from Nature Journal back in Dec 2006, which shows a reconstruction of Antarctic temperature anomalies since 1957 over east and west Antarctica. According to the study.....the continent-wide average near-surface temperature trend is positive. I am not saying that Weinstein is wrong. I am not sure. There is obviously some difference in opinion in regards to this 50-year trend. 5. Weinstein states.....Greenland and the arctic region are presently no warmer than they were in the late 1930?s, and are presently cooling ! The image below shows the temperature trends over the Arctic, including Greenland since 1981. Image courtesy NASA. Where is that cooling he was talking about? I guess he meant parts of Siberia. 6. Weinstein states......it may be that the combination of the two (or more) volcanoes, along with Solar variability and variations in ocean currents (i.e., PDO) may explain the major causes of recent surface temperature rises to about 2002. In fact, the average Earth temperature stopped rising after 2002, and has been dropping for the last few years! Mt. Pinatubo caused a period of cooling, not warming in the early 1990's. Weinstein also fails to mention the recent La Nina (late 2007/2008), which almost certainly had a role in the recent short term period of cooling. Also, depending on the source, the most recent period of global cooling was was less than two years in length and now appears to be creeping back up again in 2009, especially now that the most recent La Nina is officially dead. 7. Weinstein states....While some overall trends can be reasonably made based on looking at past historical trends, and some computational models can suggest some suggested trends due to specific forcing factors, nevertheless, the long term predicted result has not been shown to be valid . Our overall assessment (IPCC)........ Coupled models have evolved and improved significantly since the SAR. In general, they provide credible simulations of climate, at least down to sub-continental scales and over temporal scales from seasonal to decadal. The varying sets of strengths and weaknesses that models display lead us to conclude that no single model can be considered \"best\" and it is important to utilize results from a range of coupled models. We consider coupled models, as a class, to be suitable tools to provide useful projections of future climates . Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 8. Weinstein states.....The overall effect of Antarctic and Greenland are now resulting in net gain (or at least near zero change) of ice, not loss. ScienceDaily (Feb. 25, 2009) ? The Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets are melting , but the amounts that will melt and the time it will take are still unknown, according to Richard Alley, Evan Pugh professor of geosciences, Penn State. Seems like more controversy. --------------- Bio courtesy of Energy Probe. Leonard Weinstein received a B.S. in Physics in 1962 from Florida State University.

As I usually do, I search the web for an article that sticks out to me, and this subject has been in the news quite a bit recently, so I figured I would pass it on to you. This article asks the question \"Does global warming pose a threat to the airline industry?\" At first glance, I said, oh my, another loose cannon of an idea. How in the world are these two subjects even remotely related? After reading the article, maybe these two ideas are related a little more closely than I had first thought. What if global ocean temperatures did rise? A big if, I know that. Would this lead to stronger updrafts from more frequent and stronger thunderstorms? Should pilots just try to avoid thunderstorms all together when they fly? This may not always be possible and almost always will be inconvenient to the pilots and everyone on board as this will often cause delays. This question then needs to be asked, are delays worth it when you are talking about the risk of human lives? I think everyone knows the answer to that question. However, this article and any theories about global warming causing catastrophic events like this need to be taken with a grain of salt. As is so often pointed out to me and heard in the courthouse of public opinion, who even knows if global warming caused by man is occurring? Until we prove that it is or it is not happening, maybe we should use our time on more important subjects rather than trying to guess if helped cause a devastating plane crash.

Juneau, Alaska Why is this happening? Most glaciers in and near Juneau are retreating 30 feet a year or more due to warming. The land underneath the glaciers, now being relieved of billions of tons of glacial weight, has risen much as a cushion regains its shape after someone gets up from a couch. The movement of tectonic plates in the earth's crust is also adding to the land rise, but at a much slower rate. The land is actually rising so fast that rising seas (a byproduct of global warming) cannot keep pace, so the relative sea level is falling around the Juneau region. Greenland and just a few other locations on the earth have experienced this as well. The rising land, which is leading to receding water, is also causing some streams and wetlands to dry out. This is also creating more property arguments among neighbors who seeing their acreage increase. In and around Juneau, \"you can walk around and see what was underwater is turning into grassland and eventually into forest,\" said Dr. Eran Hood, a hydrologist from the University of Alaska Southeast. Relative to the sea, land here has risen as much as 10 feet in little more than 200 years, according to the 2007 report. As global warming accelerates, the land will continue to rise, perhaps three more feet by 2100, scientists say. In Gustavus, Alaska the land is rising almost three inches a year, Dr. Bruce Molnia of the USGS said, making it \"the fastest-rising place in North America.\" --------- The retreat of Muir Glacier, Glacier Bay, Alaska. 1941 1950 2004 The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"f3b4a59e7311d2a8b4ccb192a9337bb7fe314ac6"}

A new study conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and just published in the Journal of Climate now predicts a median probability of surface warming of 9.3 F (5.2 degrees Celsius) by 2100, with a 90% probability range of 6.3 F to 13.3F (3.5 to 7.4 degrees Celsius). A similar study from MIT back in 2003 predicted a median increase of 4.3 F (2.4 degrees Celsius). In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted a rise of anywhere from 2 to 11 degrees F by 2100. The study used the MIT Integrated Global Systems Model. The research team ran the model a total 400 times using different simulations. The model runs a detailed computer simulation of global economic activity and computer processes that have been developed and refined since the 1990's. Why the change since 2003? Much of the change can be attributed to improved economic modeling and newer economic data showing less chance of low emissions than had been projected in earlier scenarios. To illustrate the range of probabilities revealed by the 400 simulations, study co-author Ronald Prinn and the team produced a \" roulette wheel \" that reflects the latest relative odds of various levels of temperature rise. Prinn stresses that the computer models are built to match the known conditions, processes and past history of the relevant human and natural systems, and the researchers are therefore dependent on the accuracy of this current knowledge. Beyond this, \"we do the research, and let the results fall where they may,\" he says. Since there are so many uncertainties, especially with regard to what human beings will choose to do and how large the climate response will be, \"we don't pretend we can do it accurately. Instead, we do these 400 runs and look at the spread of the odds.\" ------------ USATODAY has a short article on this story as well.

Working with data collected over the past 50 years, and comparing the data to climate models that correct for naturally occurring salinity variations in the ocean, Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution at the Met Office, has found that man-made global warming, over and above any possible natural sources of global warming, such as carbon dioxide given off by volcanoes or increases in the heat output of the sun, may be responsible for making parts of the North Atlantic Ocean more salty, according to the article from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The increase in North Atlantic salinity over the past 50 years has been less than 1%, but that is still significant, according to Stott. Salinity levels directly affect seawater density (salty water is denser than fresh) and the circulation of ocean currents from the tropics to the poles. These currents control how heat is carried within the oceans and ultimately regulate the world's climate. Second, sea surface salinity is intimately linked to Earth's overall water cycle and to how much freshwater leaves and enters the oceans through evaporation and precipitation. The conveyor belt of the world's ocean currents. The low resolution graphic below shows the observed and predicted salinity changes over the top 500 meters of seawater in the Atlantic. Graphic courtesy of the JPL. Important paragraph from the article........ Stott?s analysis suggests that global warming is changing precipitation patterns over our planet. Higher temperatures increase evaporation in subtropical zones; the moisture is then carried by the atmosphere towards higher latitudes (towards the poles), and by trade winds across Central America to the Pacific, where it provides more precipitation. This process concentrates the salt in the water left behind in the North Atlantic, causing salinity to increase.

This week I came up with a doozie of a story, one that combines global warming...... and spiders!!! According to this article a species of spiders in northeastern Greenland known as the wolf spider (scientific name Pardosa Glacialis) is getting bigger, and these researchers are wondering if it is at least partly due to global warming. Their reasoning? Basically warmer temperatures lead to a longer and earlier start to the summer and growing seasons, thus making more food available leading to bigger spiders. As mentioned before, I am a animal lover (though not a huge fan of insects or spiders, but I guess a pretty small percentage of the population is!!) and articles like this spark my curiosity about what changes in species' populations and distributions may result due to climate change. We hear all the time about the possible plight of the polar bear due to climate change. What other species of animal or even plant may be particularly susceptible to changes in the climate? Is there any species that are particularly well-adapted to a changing environment or a warmer, drier or even moister environment (depending, of course, where the animal or plant lives)? If anyone knows any species in particular peril or species being able to use global warming to their advantage, please comment on them.

The most common measure of a solar cycle's intensity is the number of sunspots, the more spots, the more solar storms. Earlier predictions allowed for a higher number of sunspots. Image courtesy of NOAA. The panel predicts that the upcoming solar cycle 24 (which keeps getting delayed) will peak in May of 2013, with a maximum of 90 sun spots per day on average. If this new prediction is correct, it would make solar cycle 24 the weakest since 1928, when it peaked out with 78 sunspots. Solar cycle 24 would also be the 9th weakest season since the 1750's, when numbered cycles began. Also, solar cycle 23, which is ending, could end up being the longest cycle since 1823. An unusually long, deep lull in sunspots led the panel to revise its 2007 prediction that the next cycle of solar storms would start in March 2008 and peak in late 2011 or mid-2012.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with current atmospheric levels close to 1800 parts per billion and increasing, says Dr. David Etheridge from CSIRO. The most common natural source of atmospheric methane is through decomposition of organic material in wetlands, but the greatest potential source of atmospheric methane is trapped in methane hydrates, or clathrates, which are located deep on the ocean floor or under permafrost, according to the ABC Science article. What they found...... The research team checked the levels of naturally occurring carbon-14 isotopes in methane over a period of 300 years at the start of the warming, which was about 12,000 years ago. Methane from clathrates is millions of years old and contains no C14, whereas methane from wetlands is more recent and has a higher level of C14. \"The increase in the methane was not accompanied by a decrease in the C14, which tells us the origin was the wetlands not the clathrates,\" said Dr. Etheridge. These findings should reduce concern about the massive release of methane from clathrates in the near future, according to Etheridge. ---------- Here is a more detailed look at methane clathrates, along with an audio presentation.

The Earth Day Network is a great site to check out what events are scheduled for today across the globe and what actions you can take to help make a greener planet. Now to the stalagmite story Researchers from the Australia National University have determined that ancient stalagmites in a submerged Italian cave indicate that there were sea level rises caused by global warming more than 200,000 years ago. Uranium isotope dating techniques showed the stalagmites recorded water levels in the cave as far back as between 190,000 and 245,000 years ago, according to the ABC Science (Australia) article. Lead author Dr. Andrea Dutton says the strength of the stalagmite archive is that it is not as susceptible to alteration by the environment when compared with coral reef clusters that are also commonly used to date sea water rises. Dutton says their study shows that \"the lag time between temperature change and the sea level rise may not be as long as expected\". It was previously believed that temperature rise preceded ice sheet melting by more than 3000 years. This suggests ice sheets are capable of responding quickly to increasing temperature and CO2, and that the current melting of ice sheets may happen faster than expected, according to the report.

This resulted in a net 10% increase in the amount of carbon stored by the land once other effects were taken into account,\" said Dr. Lina Mercado, from the CEH and lead author of the study. The atmospheric particles (aerosols), which can create these hazy days, scatter light so that the surface receives light from multiple directions (diffuse radiation) rather than coming straight from the sun. Plants are then able to convert more of the available sunlight into growth because fewer leaves are in the shade. \"Although many people believe that well-watered plants grow best on a bright sunny day, the reverse is true.

Increasing greenhouse gases actually cool the upper stratosphere , which is about 18-31 miles above the earth's surface. This cooling slows the chemical reactions that deplete ozone in the upper stratosphere and allows natural ozone production in that region to outpace destruction by CFCs, according to the ScienceDaily article. This accumulation of greenhouse gases also changes the circulation of stratospheric air masses from the tropics to the poles. In the mid-latitudes, ozone will most likely \"over-recover\" through the end of the century (bad news for the sun block lotion business), while in the tropics, ozone may not fully recover or see no recovery. The findings are based on a detailed computer model that includes atmospheric chemical effects, wind changes, and solar radiation changes. Based on the model, recovery in the Arctic is expected by 2025, while globally averaged and Antarctic concentrations of ozone are expected to recover by 2040. The recovery in the middle and polar latitudes might have some benefits such as lower levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface and correspondingly lower rates of skin cancer. On the other hand, it could have unintended effects, such as increasing ozone levels in the troposphere, the layer of atmosphere at Earth's surface. ------------- Latest update on the ozone hole The ozone hole over the Antarctic peaks during the month of September.

Thin seasonal ice, which is ice that melts and re-freezes every year, makes up about 70 percent of the Arctic sea ice in wintertime, up from 40 to 50 percent in the 1980s and 1990s.

Globally (-70S to 82.5N): +.172 K Continental U.S.: +.619 K Northern Hemisphere: +.227 K Southern Hemisphere: +.115 K ----------------------------- Here is the global temperature anomaly map for March Note: The unusual warming over the southern U.S. and from southeastern Russia through the Middle East. Note: The unusual cold over western Canada and parts of northern Russia. The cool phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) clearly shows up with the significant warming over the northwestern Pacific and the cool band extending northeast from Hawaii. ----------------- The latest RSS measured lower troposhere decadal trend You can clearly see that a majority of the decadal warming since since 1979 has been in the northern hemisphere, especially in the Arctic regions. ----------------- As the lower troposphere warms, the stratosphere cools The image shows the decadal temperature trend of the stratosphere, and as you can see much of stratosphere (varies from 6 to 31 miles above the earth's surface) has been cooling. What causes the stratosphere to cool? 1. Depletion of stratospheric ozone. 2. Increase in atmospheric CO2. There is a good explanation of why the stratosphere cools due to the greenhouse effect in the middle of this page from espere. ------------ Acknowledgement MSU/AMSU data are produced by Remote Sensing Systems and sponsored by the NOAA Climate and Global Change Program.

Image courtesy BAS. The Wilkins Ice bridge breaks up. Image taken April 4th, 2009. Image courtesy BAS. Most of you by now have heard about the very recent collapse of the Antarctic ice bridge (25 miles long) connecting the Wilkins Ice Shelf to Charcot Island. I read up on the details of this collapse from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ). Here are some of the important points that were brought up about this situation........... 1. The scientists see climate change as the main culprit. The Antarctic Peninsula is the fastest warming region on earth in the past 50 years. The region has warmed 2.5 degrees celsius or 4 degrees F. during that period. 2. The Wilkins Ice shelf is a broad plate of permanent floating ice that covers over 5,000 square miles. 3. This particular breakup of the ice bridge happened between March 31st and April 6th. 4. The Wilkins Ice shelf, which has supposedly been in place for a few hundred years, first began breaking up in the mid 1990's. 5. Scientists are still trying to figure out whether this particular event will allow to the ice shelf to collapse further in the near future, perhaps as early as the next melt season. A view from space of the ice shelf on March 31st, 2009. Image courtesy of NASA. The same view showing the break up of the ice bridge on April 6th, 2009. What are the consequences of this ice bridge collapse? 1. The ice bridge, which was bracing the remaining portions of the Wilkins Ice shelf, will now allow a mass of broken ice and icebergs to drift into the southern ocean. This could eventually be an concern for some ships that travel that far south. 2. The further collapse of the shelf in itself will not directly raise sea levels, since it already floats on the water. 3. But, the collapse could allow land based glaciers and ice sheets that normally feed into the ice shelf to start flowing ice into the open ocean at an accelerated rate, which would contribute to a rise in sea levels. Some research suggests that there would be a 20-foot rise in sea level if the entire Greenland Ice sheet melted away, while a 200-foot rise would occur if the entire Antarctic Ice sheet were to melt. ------------------------------------ Facts about ice shelves.

Various forms of climate geoengineering. Climate geoengineering involves the large-scale, deliberate modification of the Earth's environment to suit human needs and habitability. In this case, it is the act of deliberately manipulating the Earth's climate to counteract the effects of global warming from greenhouse gas emissions. One particular option that was mentioned in the AP interview with John Holdren, who is the president's new science adviser, is shooting pollution particles into the upper atmosphere to reflect the sun's rays. Holdren cautioned that such a measure would only be used as a last resort. A second option that he mentioned was the use of artificial trees to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and put it in storage. ----------- In his Tuesday blog on Accuweather Professional, expert senior meteorologist and long-range specialist Joe Bastardi voices his opinion about this particular idea of geoengineering............... Madness Takes Control This is lunacy: http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D97ECHLG1&show_article=1 The idea that you will shoot pollutants in the air to cool the atmosphere shows the lunacy of the people advising President Obama. If you are an environmentalist that supports the AGW ideas, this should really have you question the motives of these people. Why? WE SPENT DECADES AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS CLEANING UP THE AIR, NOW WE WANT TO TRASH THE AIR AGAIN. BY THE WAY, VOLCANOES WILL DO THE JOB FOR YOU. But aside from that, this is yet another scare tactic, to force people NOT TO LOOK AT DATA TO THE CONTRARY. I cannot believe the extent of the irrationality I am seeing with idea like this. I don't care how many PHDs you have, you are basically saying that what we did to clean the air caused warming, since you are saying we have to dirty it back up again to stop it. What other conclusions can you draw? That you do not even think of this, the implications of what is says, shows the argument is meant for those who will not think for themselves. Here is the global temp with the IPCC forecast on it: http://icecap.us/images/uploads/7YRCOOLINGSPPI.JPG I can't believe I am reading this. It is arrogance pure and simple, believing you will control what you did not create. In addition, just what do you think will happen to all that garbage you shoot into the air? I am telling you right now, this can't be anything but a ruse to scare people into thinking we are boiling up, to try to get cap and trade, which is dead in the senate, back on track again. It's as if the colder it gets the more they ratchet it up. You give me my 10-20 years; no one is going to burn up and we will have the answer. And if I am wrong, then you will have a forceful advocate on your side. But everything I see coming out of people advising the president looks to be crafted as sound bites to get the public's attention. It's almost as if they have taken a page out of Woodrow Wilson's history, who wished for something less than a war, an environmental catastrophe, to unite the world around. The real shame is that it's hard to concentrate on the wildness of the pattern, the links back to 1951 and 1975, for instance, in trying to teach that aspect, with rantings from what is clearly becoming an extremist mantra, making headlines and being used as if it's accepted truth. I want you to think exactly about what President Obama's advisor is advocating here... shooting back into the air the very items we worked so hard to clean out. Why the heck did we clean it up in the first place if it would mean we are so warm? And see, this is WHY THESE GUYS ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE SAYING, OR ARE IRRATIONAL. Because what this actually says is that DIRTYING THE AIR, IF IT'S A PREVENTIVE MEASURE, MEANS IT COULD BE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM SINCE IF WE HAD LEFT THE POLLUTION, THEN IT WOULD BE COOLER! They shoot down their own CO2 argument as one can argue easily that if dirty air makes it cooler, then cleaning it caused the warming, AND CO2 IS A SIDESHOW. As I said, madness takes control.

Aerosols are tiny, airborne particles that can be emitted by natural or human sources. Sources of aerosols on earth. Two specific types of aerosols play a critical role in regulating climate change. They are sulfates and black carbon, which are products of human activity, according to the NASA article. Sulfates, which come primarily from the burning of coal and oil, scatter incoming solar radiation and have a net cooling effect on climate. Reductions by 50% from major source countries has improved air quality, but has also resulted in less atmospheric cooling. Black carbon absorbs incoming solar radiation and has a strong warming influence on the atmosphere. Compared to sulfates, black carbon emissions continue to steadily rise, mainly due to growth over in Asia. The regions of Earth that showed the strongest responses to aerosols in the model are the same regions that have witnessed the greatest real-world temperature increases since 1976. The Arctic region has seen its surface air temperatures increase by 1.5 C (2.7 F) since the mid-1970s. Below are direct excerpts from the NASA article that are important to state....... That makes sense, Drew Shindell of NASA's GISS explained, because of the Arctic's proximity to North America and Europe. The two highly industrialized regions have produced most of the world's aerosol emissions over the last century, and some of those aerosols drift northward and collect in the Arctic. Precipitation, which normally flushes aerosols out of the atmosphere, is minimal there, so the particles remain in the air longer and have a stronger impact than in other parts of the world. Since decreasing amounts of sulfates and increasing amounts of black carbon both encourage warming, temperature increases can be especially rapid. The build-up of aerosols also triggers positive feedback cycles that further accelerate warming as snow and ice cover retreat. In the Antarctic, in contrast, the impact of sulfates and black carbon is minimized because of the continent's isolation from major population centers and the emissions they produce. \"Right now, in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and in the Arctic, the impact of aerosols is just as strong as that of the greenhouse gases.\" Can this be fixed? Aerosols tend to be quite-short lived, residing in the atmosphere for just a few days or weeks. Greenhouses gases, by contrast, can persist for hundreds of years. Atmospheric chemists theorize that the climate system may be more responsive to changes in aerosol levels over the next few decades than to changes in greenhouse gas levels, which will have the more powerful effect in coming centuries.

One of them was a high school math/science teacher in Massachusetts. Everyone always knew I was a certified weather nut, and would always bring the weather into my lessons, whether it was in a math class with probabilities or in a science lesson (much easier to do since I taught earth science). Other jobs I had were, in no particular order, a house painter, pizza deliverer, pharmacist technician, construction and a clerk at a video store. Not sure why I'm telling you this.... well, besides the fact that I feel very lucky to finally work (and get paid!!) to do something I love... Well, one of the things I did teach was climate change and both man's and natural force's roles in the atmosphere. One question I heard from numerous students is how climate change and the depletion of the ozone layer were one and the same. I would always tell them that they were completely unrelated and had nothing to do with one another (I know that CFC's are a strong greenhouse gas, but I kept it is simple as possible for them and I didn't really get into that). Well, it turns out, according to this article at least, that I was wrong! What a shock.... By reading this article, if I am understanding it correctly, climate change could be setting up circulation patterns that are thinning the ozone layer where is thickest (the tropics) and thickening the ozone layer where it is the thinnest (the poles). This would lead to more harmful UV rays reaching the earth's surface in the tropics where a) the rays are the strongest and b) where more people than as compared to the poles and c) where people wear less clothes. These factors could combine to cause problems in the tropics and subtropics.

You can watch the short video by clicking the link below...... Willie Soon talks about possible impacts of a dimmer sun Some of the possible scenarios that Soon discussed......... 1. A reduced energy input from a dimmer sun will result in less heating of the oceans' surface, which would lead to less evaporation from the ocean surface. The result of this would be a decrease in water vapor, which is by far the earth's major greenhouse gas. 2. Less water vapor would result in a decrease in high cirrus clouds, which trap more heat than they reflect. 3. A reduced energy input from the sun would equal less energy to bring water vapor high into the atmosphere, so more would end up collecting a few kilometers from the surface, resulting in more low clouds. Low clouds are much more effective at reflecting sunlight, which would produce a net cooling effect. ----------- Dr. Soon is also associated with the George C.

I came across this article on the internet and it piqued my interest. First of all, since I had never heard of \"Earth Hour\", I wondered what exactly it was. I had heard of Earth Day, but Earth Hour? How long has it been around? Who came up with this idea? How many people know about it, or more importantly, plan to do something for it, or even care about it at all? In general, I think events like this that try to let people know how important the earth is to us human beings is great. For me as an environmentalist and someone who respects and loves the earth and knows how gravely serious the health of our planet is to us, and who respects and admires the beauty of a snowstorm, a thunderstorm, or even a sunset, I think that these events (ie. Earth Day, Earth Hour, etc.) are all based on a good idea. Namely, to try to get other people involved in respecting the beauty and importance of the earth. What I worry about is do events like these tend to be ridiculed by normal, everyday people; does it shed a \"bad\" light, almost an over-zealous sort of feeling, towards the people that are organizing and participating in these events? I'm afraid that people that are active in these events are looked upon as different, kind of the-end-of-the-world-is-coming-so-we-better-prepare-now-or-die type of people. People that are too busy trying to help save the earth and other different causes that they don't even take time to live their own lives. Basically, do people think of us as nature freaks that have nothing better to do than to let other people know how bad off we are treating the earth, at least in our minds and opinions. Do you think that people involved in these activities come across this way and thus you automatically are turned off towards their feelings and philosophies? Another question, do events like this do more harm than good in trying to get normal, ordinary Joe or Jane to think a little more like these people? Or is getting the idea out to respect and love \"Mother Earth\" more important than how one comes across trying to get the idea out in public?

Through his research, Lindzen concludes that the earth is dominated by a strong net negative feedback and that any warming that arises from increasing greenhouse gases will be indistinguishable from the natural fluctuations in climate from processes internal to the climate system itself. Lindzen also notes that the climate models which show alarming predictions are based on large positive feedbacks, which goes against the behavior of nature in his opinion.

The boom in climate change lobbying, some experts say, can be traced to the passage of an energy bill in late 2007 when members of Congress wrangled over whether to require utilities to use renewable energy sources. The provision was eventually dropped from the bill, but it pointed the way the green debate was going, according to the Chronicle. \"There are more people saying 'Yes, we've got to do something' than there are saying 'no,' says Tony Kriendler of the Environmental Defense Fund, in regards to energy companies, which certainly have a stake in the game.

The team led by Dr. Anastasios Tsonis applied the math equation to climate data taken over the past 100 years. Eventually, the systems begin to couple and the synchronous state is destroyed, leading to a climate shift. \"The research team has found the warming trend of the past 30 years has stopped and in fact global temperatures have leveled off since 2001,\" according to Tsonis. What's the human impact? Tsonis does not think we can say much about what impact humans are having since we still do not fully understand the natural variability of climate. The team realized a lot of changes in the past century from warmer to cooler and then back to warmer were all natural. According to the article, Tsonis believes the current trend of steady or even cooling earth temps may last a couple of decades or until the next climate shift occurs.

Based on their data, the team concluded that the Earth is headed toward another thaw, but that it could take a thousand years or more to complete. Emperor penquins hanging out at the ANDRILL site in Antarctica. During the Pliocene epoch 3 to 5 million years ago--a time when conditions in Antarctica are similar to today's--the ice in Antarctica collapsed and melted on a regular basis, raising world sea levels. Ice began melting on a massive scale when atmospheric CO2 levels rose to around 400 PPM. Today, that number is at 386 PPM and slowly rising. Two climate modelers say that it would take 1,000 or more years from the beginning of a warm-up until the West Antarctic ice sheet would melt away. Over history, there have been polar freeze/thaw cycles every 40,000 years due to the natural shift in the tilt of the earth's axis. Depending on which hemisphere is tilted closest to the sun, this natural process periodically leads to a natural build up of atmospheric CO2.

But it is much more complicated than that, and we (humans) seem to be throwing the pattern off balance now. It used to be that carbon dioxide rises were driven by the cycle.

Is the sunspot cycle changing from the normal 11 year pattern? Is it just delayed, which as I've read occurs from time to time? Or is there something out of the ordinary going on here (ie. Maunder Minimum type of event)? This article talks about predicting the solar cycle. I had a long conversation with a friend of mine, and we brought up and talked about such topics as global warming, sunspots, the solar \"constant\" (in quotations since it is really not constant), and how the earth affects its own radiation balance. One thing that stood out to me is when he said that \"things aren't that simple, or we would know that by now\". I always look for simple relationships, ie. low number of sunpots, less solar energy reaching the surface of the earth, cooler climate. In theory sure, that maybe true, but in reality, the climate system as a whole is very complex and solar energy entering the earth's atmosphere, while an important piece to the climate puzzle, is just that, only a piece. So, while this correlation makes sense, it is definitely not as simple as this. The earth's climate is way to complicated of a puzzle to be solved just by this, with feedback mechanisms, albedo, etc. being involved. Another area I'm interested in relates to sunspots, but also to cosmic rays and low and high clouds. As we know, low clouds are generally a \"cooling\" agent in the earth's atmosphere, since they block more incoming radiation from reaching the earth's surface than reradiating downwards outgoing longwave radiation. High clouds are the opposite, usually a \"warming\" agent. In theory, the more active the sun is, the more cosmic rays, the more clouds are formed, due to a process I'm not really familiar with. I am not familiar with whether or not the clouds would be high or low either, but since sunspots are associated with warming, I'll assume the increase in clouds would be of the high variety. Does anyone have further information about this? Am I at least barking up the right tree here? By the way, my friend believes we are going to be in a period of about 40 years of slight cooling, because of many reasons, but one is that he believes that sunspot activity will be lower than normal during that period. It will be very interesting to see what happens to the number of sunspots in the next month, the next several months, the next year and the next few years.

I always post blogs a little lighter in the subject matter than Bret and I will continue this trend and bring it down even another level by going even lighter than I usually do... First off, let me tell you how lucky I am to have a great job like this. I hear about how bad the economy is, and how many people in this great country don't have jobs and others are in danger of losing their jobs, and I feel honored, privileged and just plain lucky to get paid to do something that I love. I feel this way even more so because of my personal situation. I graduated college in 1996 with a degree in meteorology and this is my first job in this great field. Every day I wake up and pinch myself and tell myself that I really get paid to work with the weather everyday. Actually, working overnights I wake up every afternoon or evening and pinch myself at that time, but that is another story for a later time. I feel this way especially more so because of how many crappy jobs I had to work supporting me and my sons (sorry Gary Ring, you are a good friend and a great guy, but your job was the worst, being a house painter in New England, umm, how can I say this politely, isn't cool...lol. Sweating profusely while scraping lead paint off a banister on a roof 60 feet above the ground in baking sunshine just isn't what I was cut out for). Anyways, around AccuWeather, the overnight staff jokes all the time about Global Warming only happening aloft (we joke about everything, but I don't think it is politically correct to mention everything we joke about). I know that probably 90% of it is just that, a joke. But, underlying this joke, I think some meteorologists here are at least a little bit serious about the warming aloft and it makes me wonder. How many \"all snow\" events do we see in say, central Pennsylvania, or in central Massachusetts (where I spent 33 years of my life before coming here to State College)? This winter not many. The previous winter? Not many. I remember times past being a kid and young adult in Leicester, Mass. and seeing massive all-snow events (December of 1992, April!!! 1st of 1997, etc). Of course, I remember some sleet and freezing rain events too (in the superstorm of March 1993 we had alot of sleet and some freezing rain) . The question I guess I'm posing in this blog is, do we have areas in this country where \"all-snow\" events are becoming rarer, maybe rarer isn't right word but less common? The running punchline at night is that we should rename State College to \"sleet\" College. I have absolutely no hard evidence one way or another, I'm just posing the question. Are the levels of the atmosphere where clouds are and precipitation falls from and through, about 900-750 millibars of pressure or about 3,000 feet to approx. 8,000 feet above the surface of the earth showing more of a warming than the surface of the earth itself and thus producing more sleet and freezing rain at the expense of snow? Are the ice storms that occurred in central New England and upstate New York in December and later in Kentucky a few weeks ago associated with global warming or climate change? What do you think?

His theory involves a massive sun shield. The shield would cover about 100,000 square miles and be made up by trillions of mirrors that would be launched (fired) into space about one million miles above earth. The shield would form a \"sun shade\" that would deflect the sun's rays. The article does not say how much of the sun's rays would be deflected. How would they get the mirrors launched that far out into space? They would use a huge (and I mean huge!!) cannon, which would pack 100 times the power of conventional weapons. The barrel of this cannon would need to be over a half mile (.6 miles) in diameter! I can't imagine the amount of noise and ground shaking this thing would produce. The cannon would need to be fired at least a million times. If the project can get going in the near future, it could be ready to launch in 20 or 30 years. If successful, the mirrors could last 50 years before being replaced. Angel says that the cost of the project would be about 350 trillion dollars! So far, Dr. Angel has secured NASA funding for a pilot project. Researchers at the University of Victoria, Canada are currently testing the sun shield theory by using computer simulations.

Much of it includes the earlier consensus findings of from the 4th Assessment Report of the IPCC . --Global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have increased markedly as a result of human activities since 1750 and now far exceed pre-industrial values determined from ice cores spanning many thousands of years. --Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level. --Very high confidence that the global average net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming. --Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have grown since pre-industrial times, with an increase of 70% between 1970 and 2004. --Palaeoclimatic information supports the interpretation that the warmth of the last half century is unusual in at least the previous 1,300 years. --Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. This is an advance since the TAR?s conclusion that \"most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.\" --For the next two decades, a warming of about 0.2°C per decade is projected for a range of SRES emission scenarios. --Anthropogenic warming and sea level rise would continue for centuries due to the time scales associated with climate processes and feedbacks, even if greenhouse gas concentrations were to be stabilized. --Drought-affected areas will likely increase in extent. Heavy precipitation events, which are very likely to increase in frequency, will augment flood risk. --Many millions more people are projected to be flooded every year due to sea-level rise by the 2080s. --Energy efficiency options for new and existing buildings could considerably reduce CO2 emissions with net economic benefit. --In order to stabilize the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere, emissions would need to peak and decline thereafter. The lower the stabilization level, the more quickly this peak and decline would need to occur. Mitigation efforts over the next two to three decades will have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower stabilization levels. ----------------------- You can read the full testimony from Dr. Field right here. ---------- Major funding to Dr. Field and the Carnegie Institution for Science provided by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Vannevar Bush Society, Edwin Hubble Society and the Carnegie Founders Society.

An atmospheric science professor from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says that this recent flat line of temperatures does not appear to have a firm cause, unlike previous cooling events since 1950 that were influenced by strong La Nina's and volcanic eruptions. Associate Professor Kyle Swanson and colleague Anastasios Tsonis think a series of climate processes have aligned, conspiring to chill the climate. According to Swanson, global temperatures should have gone up .2 C or .36 F between 2001 and 2007, but instead the temperatures have been nearly flat. So what could be the cause? Swanson believes that there could be several reasons. Here are the two that were listed..... 1. Sinking water currents in the North Atlantic could be sucking heat down into the deeper depths. 2. Greater than normal amount of tropical cloudiness, which is reflecting more of the sun's energy back into space. Swanson thinks the trend could continue for up to 30 years. But he warned that it's just a hiccup, and that humans' penchant for spewing greenhouse gases will certainly come back to haunt us. Here is the link to the Discovery News article.

Outcrops of ultramafic rocks. Ultramafic rocks in the United States could be enough to stash more than 500 years of U.S. carbon dioxide production, according to lead author Sam Krevor, who is a graduate student working through the Earth Institute's Lenfest Center for Sustainable Energy. \"We're trying to show that anyone within a reasonable distance of these rock formations could use this process to sequester as much carbon dioxide as possible,\" said Krevor. Most of the rock formations (see the map associated with the press release ) are clustered in strips along the more populated east and west coasts. These ultramafic rocks form in the earth's mantle, between twelve and hundreds of miles under the surface. When the rocks are exposed to carbon dioxide they react and form common limestone and chalk.

While doing one of my favorite pastimes, browsing the internet (what did I used to do in my free time, oh ya, play basketball) I came across this article that describes temperature trends that a former climatologist and professor at Montana State University, Joseph Caprio, has seen over 54 years at Bozeman and Coldstream, Montana. A couple of trends noticed by Mr. Caprio in this article are: - He noted that warm extreme nighttime temperatures are occurring more often. -The greatest warming observed has been in two time periods, from late February through March, and then again from late July to August. -I don't think Mr. Caprio had direct input into this study, but scientists have observed that glaciers at Glacier National Park are disappearing, with 84% of the park's ice and snow fields gone. Some of these scientists believe that all glaciers in the park may be gone as soon as 2030. This article brings up some interesting points. It made me wonder about how animal and plant life are dealing with these changes in the climate in the wonderful state of Montana. Do grizzly bears hibernate for a shorter time now? As Brett mentioned in a blog a week or so ago, bird species are beginning to be noticed in areas where \"they shouldn't be\". Are the same changes going to happen in Montana? Are they happening as we speak? How will the disappearance or shrinkage of glaciers in this area of the country affect the people and the wildlife? Will rivers be different at all (will there water source(s) be changed)? How will tourism in the area be different? I mean if someone comes to see the glaciers, and all of a sudden they are not there, will they still come to visit the region? Basic questions, sure, but I believe they are valid ones. Other questions that pop-up in my mind are why are nighttime temperatures affected more than any other time? Why are those two time periods, late winter and late summer, being altered more than any other time of the year?

Professor Andrew Dessler, the author of this study, which is published in the journal Science, concludes that evidence of this strong, positive water vapor feedback is overwhelming. According to Dessler, this feedback process will be responsible for a significant portion of the predicted warming over the next century and will double the heating caused by carbon dioxide alone.

Much like the Bangladesh article I blogged about last week, this article discusses a similar subject matter (How will climate change affect this area?), only this time it is a little closer to home. Newly-appointed Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, is worried about the effects global warming may have on his home state of California. More specifically, he is worried about the water supply that keeps many Californian farms in business and lets them irrigate their crops during the dry season. Obviously, the average American has more concerns about the water supply in this area than someplace overseas for several reasons: 1) California is in our country and we can follow the weather and climate in this area more closely than say.... Bangladesh. We can see when they are experiencing a drought and when they are not, and we also hear about concerns/problems with the water supply. 2) With a huge and growing population, changes in California's climate may affect us directly if we live there or have friends or family who live there. Or if we move there when we retire, or get a job and move to the area when we are younger. 3) As is mentioned in the article, California supplies more than half of America's fruits, vegetables and nuts. Any change in the water supply will obviously affect both the amount of these goods produced and the price we pay for these items at the neighborhood grocery store. 4) Because of California's unique climate, water is already a precious commodity. If water becomes even more scarce, what changes (climatologically, politically, and economically) may occur? We have heard the states of California, Nevada and Arizona bicker over the water in the Colorado River. Will this fighting become worse and more politically heated? 5) What happens to the businesses centered in California or nearby areas (movie/TV production in Hollywood, gambling in Las Vegas, tourism everywhere, skiing in the mountains) if the water supply becomes more limited? For residents of places where the water supply is not nearly as big of a concern as it is in California, we assume there will always be water for whatever needs we have. Residents of the water-deprived areas of the western US know how precious the water supply is and know how a dry year or years can affect almost all aspects of life. Will California feel more of a pinch due to the limits of the water supply in the future?

Researchers from the University of California and Washington propose that the only method that has a long term, efficient, practical and economic impact in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is the removal and burial of crop residues in the deep ocean and preferably off the mouths of major rivers. Why dump at the end of major rivers? River?s-end dump sites already receive a fair amount of vegetable matter that flows down river. So any ecological effect would likely be minimized compared with other parts of the deep ocean, according to the Christian Science Monitor Blog . According to the abstract and full study, which is posted in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, this process is 92% efficient in sequestration of crop residue, such as corn stalks, while cellulosic ethanol production is only 32% efficient. The research team says that this process (burial of crop residues in the deep ocean) can potentially capture 15% of the current global carbon dioxide annual increase.

Warming is expected to increase snowfall over Greenland and Antarctica, but recent studies have shown that the ice sheets are melting at a faster rate than the added snowfall to the ice sheet. Before, some scientists believed (and may still do so) that the added snowfall would offset the melting. Two of the biggest contributors to the melting of ice sheets is the formation of large lakes on the ice in Greenland and the warming of the ocean, according to the release from EurekAlert. Although those who study ice sheets have long modeled ice sheet behavior, simulations of the whole earth system typically have not included ice sheets along with the atmosphere, oceans and clouds in their models.

According to the NSIDC release from yesterday it appears that there was a malfunction of the satellite sensor which they use to produce their daily sea ice products. Through more careful investigation, it appears that starting around early January, an error known as sensor drift caused a slowly growing underestimation of Arctic sea ice extent.

According to the WMGS, a clear majority of more than 80 glaciers across the globe are still melting at high rates, according to the ScienceDaily article For the year 2007, (which is the latest data from the WGMS) the results indicate that there has been an overall additional further loss of average ice thickness of roughly 0.67 meter water equivalent (m w.e.). Some glaciers in the European Alps lost up to 2.5 m w.e. This is a time lapse look at the Vernagtferner Glacier in Austria and how it has shrunk between 1912 and 2003. Image courtesy of the United Nations Environment Program. 2007 was the 6th year this century in which the average ice loss of the referenced glaciers has exceeded a 1/2 meter in thickness, which more than doubles the melt rates of the 1980's and 1990's. The average ice loss in 2007 was not as extreme as 2006, but there were big differences between mountain ranges across the globe. In addition to the large losses in the European Alps, there were significant losses in the referenced glaciers in Columbia and Bolivia. Some glaciers actually gained mass, and those included the maritime glaciers in Scandinavia, and in western North America, the North Cascades and the Juneau Ice Field.

Also, a number of grassland species are not following this northward trend and for these species disappearing habitat from warming is taking an enormous toll, and leaving them with nowhere to go. One of our biggest movers, the Purple Finch. How did they determine this? Tens of thousands of citizen scientists take part in the Audubon's annual Christmas bird count and report their findings to the society. Based on an analysis of 305 bird species across North America, the results indicate an average northward movement of 35 miles. Sixty bird species out of the 305 actually moved in excess of 100 miles during the four decades! Here are some of the more common birds with the greatest northward movement over the forty- year period..... --Purple Finch (433 miles) --Wild Turkey (408 miles). I can usually hear the turkeys over on the hill early in the mornings, but they are tough to spot. --Ring-Billed Gull (356 miles) --Pine Siskin (288 miles).

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet. If the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapses, the rise in sea levels around many coastal regions will be as much as 25 per cent more than expected, for a total of between six and seven metres if the whole ice sheet melts,? says Jerry Mitrovica, a geophysicist. Why is that? 1. If the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapses, sea level will fall close to the Antarctic and will rise much more than the expected estimate in the northern hemisphere because when an ice sheet melts, its gravitational pull on the ocean is reduced and water moves away from it. 2. If the ice sheet collapses the depression (hole) in the Antarctic bedrock that sits under the ice sheet will fill with water. But, as the ice disappears, the hole will shrink as the region rebounds from the loss of ice, which will force some of the water out into the ocean. 3. The collapse of the ice sheet will cause the earth's rotation axis to shift 500 meters from its present condition, which will move water from the southern Atlantic and Pacific oceans northward toward North America and into the southern Indian Ocean. There is still some question as to how much ice would actually disappear if the whole sheet collapses, but even still, the researchers state that the sea-level rise that would occur at many populated coastal sites would be much larger than one would estimate by simply distributing the meltwater evenly.

Wow, I am almost overwhelmed by the comments received about my last post dealing with my mention in the Senate Minority Report on Global Warming. I can say that I truly feel lucky and honored to be mentioned in it. However, as I said in last week's blog, I don't really feel like I am a dissenter, but a proponent of man-made global warming, which in my opinion, is occurring as we speak. So, I would like to use this post to share my personal belief on man-made global warming and clear up where I stand. Unlike many of the commenters and people here who work at AccuWeather, I do not feel that I am an expert or am confident enough in my knowledge to go far in-depth on the subject of global warming. However, I do have some simple reasons why I do think it is happening. One of the reasons I think that the earth is warming is by looking at the number of record highs seen as compared to record lows. This was brought up in my last post, so I will not dwell on this here, as many people brought up great points as to why this should not be a reason for believing in man-made global warming, and I am at least considering these reasons. More importantly, another reason why I think warming is occurring is the graphs shown below. All of these increases (which would even be more dramatic if the time went back more than the 30 years as shown on the graphs) seen in these scientifically proven greenhouse gases are at least partly, if not chiefly, due to man. Simplistically, how can all of these greenhouse gases increase without influencing the earth's temperature? Even if the earth is in a natural cooling phase, how can these increases in greenhouse gases not negate somewhat this cooling? On the other hand, if the earth is in a natural warming phase, how can the changes in these gases not cause the warming to be enhanced? I just don't understand how people can know that these changes in the atmosphere are occurring, and know that these gases increase the amount of energy (warmth) kept near the earth's surface, but this information is just ignored or thought not to matter. This data may be a small piece of the atmospheric and climatic \"pie\", but isn't it a piece? And isn't it caused by man? Wouldn't this data, by itself, cause warming? Isn't this what man-made global warming is? Warming caused by man? Another reason I believe global warming is occurring is the amount of heat we release into the atmosphere. From heating our homes, to factories and power plants burning fossil fuels, to internal combustion engines in cars, trucks, tractors, etc., aren't these releasing heat into the atmosphere that would not been released if man was not on the planet? How about the decreased albedo from the miles upon miles of roadways? From buildings with dark roofs? Would they be on the planet without man? Obviously not. Yes, these factors maybe mere drops in the proverbial bucket, but don't these drops add up over time and contribute at least somewhat to man-made global warming? Yes, the earth will continue to see cold snaps (see the past 30 days in the Northeast US), but wouldn't these cold snaps be more drastic if it wasn't for man's influence? And what about how warm the west coast of the US has been? We'll hear people say, global warming, schwarming, look how cold it is where I live. Well, how about the rest of the world? What is happening there? I will continue to try and post unbiased blogs, as a scientist, that is my duty. If there is data to prove to me that global warming caused by man is not occurring, then it is also my duty as a scientist to at least consider changing my opinion. I appreciate all the readers and commenters of this website, and I will continue to do my homework and try to learn as much as I can about the fascinating subject of global warming.

This technology measures light bounced off the planet. Carbon dioxide absorbs light in some frequencies, so the less light detected, the higher the concentration of carbon. The world's oceans and land absorb much of the atmospheric CO2, but scientists have been unable to figure out where the remaining CO2 goes. Knowing these answers will help scientists and models better predict the speed and extent of carbon dioxide's impact on the world's climate. ------------------------- In a somewhat related story......Scientists are planning on using a souped-up corporate jet (and no, it is not the 50 million dollar Citigroup jet) to determine where and when some of the estimated 30 billion tons of carbon emitted annually by cars, factories, deforestation and other human activities enters the atmosphere. Roughly half the carbon emitted by humans stays in the atmosphere, with the remainder being absorbed by ocean and earth ecosystems. But scientists don't understand how the system works or how quickly various gases mix.ers the atmosphere, according to the Scientific American article . The result is that models of this so-called carbon cycle grown wildly divergent as they are projected into the future, with nearly 100 percent uncertainty by 2050 , according to Britton Stephens, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research and one of the project's principal investigators. The project will fill key gaps in our understanding of how carbon cycles through the atmosphere and among the earth, air and oceans. The new map will also provide a baseline against which efforts worldwide to curb carbon emissions can be judged. Need for such a benchmark has gained urgency, scientists and policymakers say, as the world moves toward regional, national and international agreements to limit greenhouse gases.

I was amused by this article simply from the scientific view, or its complete lack thereof. We don't know if global warming is happening, and even if it is occurring, what is it doing to Bangladesh? This country automatically says global warming is happening, you are more responsible for it than we are, you are rich, we are poor, pay me. The story doesn't mention anything about the subject, but I'll assume the damage from \"global warming\" is that ocean levels are rising, causing floods and salt water intruding inland. So, the State Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh Hasan Mahmud wants developed countries to pay for flooding and salt \"poisoning\" that may or may not be caused by global warming which, of course, may or may not be occurring also. That makes me laugh. Maybe I should come up with some story like this to make some money. Curiosity worked its way into my mind when I wondered how many other countries may try this? Is this a new way for third-world countries to get financial assistance from the \"developed nations\"? What kind of science does the government of Bangladesh use for evidence? Or are they just using public opinion to get some money for themselves? I think it is a little scary because if the government of Bangladesh can get financial assistance for this, the question of how many other countries may try this comes up, but other ponderings as well. What else can they use to try to get money? Can they use water pollution? Air pollution? Ozone depletion? Almost anything? Can they come up with make believe environmental crises to cash in?

The NAO is a very important driver of climate fluctuations in the North Atlantic and is certainly a major influence on the weather in North America and Western Europe, especially during the winter months. What they found is quite interesting. Excerpts from the WHOI press release below.......... \"Because they (coral) are slow growing and have long life-spans, corals can provide high resolution records that are well dated and centuries long\", said Nathalie Goodkin, lead author of the study. The team found the variability of the NAO decade-to-decade (multi-decadal scale) has been larger, swinging more wildly, during the late twentieth century than in the early 1800s, suggesting that variability is linked to the mean temperature of the Northern Hemisphere. \"When the Industrial Revolution begins and atmospheric temperature becomes warmer, the NAO takes on a much stronger pattern in longer-term behavior,\" said Goodkin. \"That was suspected before in the instrumental records, but this is the first time it has been documented in records from both the ocean and the atmosphere.\" \"Anthropogenic (human-related) warming does not appear to be altering whether the NAO is in a positive or negative phase at multi-decadal time scales,\" said WHOI paleoclimatologist Konrad Hughen. \"It does seem to be increasing variability. Clearly, this has implications for the future.\" \"As temperatures get warmer, there's potential for more violent swings of the NAO -- the phases becoming even more positive and even more negative,\" Hughen added. \"If the NAO locks more into these patterns, intense storms will become more intense and droughts will become more severe.\" --------------------------------- The WHOI has an an interesting graph showing the longer term variability of the NAO and how it is related to the warming.

The authors of the survey contacted over 10,200 experts listed in the 2007 edition of the American Geological Institute's Directory of Geoscience Department to take part in the on-line poll, according to the EurekAlert article. Only those invited could participate and computer IP addresses of participants were recorded and used to prevent repeat voting. Questions used were reviewed by a polling expert who checked for bias in phrasing, such as suggesting an answer by the way a question was worded. The two questions were........... 1. Have mean global temperatures risen compared to pre-1800s levels? 2. Has human activity been a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures? About 90% of the total surveyed agreed with question #1, while 82% agreed with question #2. For question #2, the authors broke it down by climatologists, petroleum geologists and meteorologists......... 97% of the climatologists agreed that human activity has been a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures, while that figure was only 64% for meteorologists and 47% for the petroleum geologists. The author, Peter Doran made an interesting quote about the meteorologists, which I, as a 20-year meteorologist, personally think is pretty much on target.....\"Most members of the public think meteorologists know climate, but most of them actually study very short-term phenomenon.\" Doran also made a point about the climatologists.....\"They're the ones who study and publish on climate science. So I guess the take-home message is, the more you know about the field of climate science, the more you're likely to believe in global warming and humankind's contribution to it.\" --------------------------------------------- Even though the survey from above may be quite revealing, we also remember the latest 2008 U.S. Senate Minority report, which indicated that more than 650 international scientists now dissent over man-made global warming claims.

To ease myself back into the routine, I want to use this post to comment on the latest 2008 U.S. Senate Minority report, which can be found here . As Brett brought to my attention, I was featured as 1 of more than 650 international scientists who challenged man-made global warming claims by the IPCC and Al Gore. My quotes are from a blog I posted in November, and are found on page 61 in this report. First, I will say that this is quite an honor personally. To be mentioned in the same breath as these scientists is quite a compliment. I'm not sure I belong in this report with these scientists, to be completely honest. I have emailed some friends and family this report and told them how thankful and proud I am to be quoted! However, and this may surprise some of you, I am not really a \"man-made global warming dissenter\". In matter of fact, I am a big believer in man-made global warming. I try to stay neutral when I post blogs, but personally, when friends or family ask me about what I think about global warming, I tell them I believe that global warming is occurring, and at least some part of this warming is due to man. I was actually going to use this blog, before I read Brett's email, to comment on something I saw on TV back at home this past weekend that goes along with my personal beliefs. A competitor of ours here at AccuWeather.com (who will go nameless), features a segment which keeps track of the record high and low temperatures for what I believe is the past week, month, year and decade. Even with all of the cold that has been so well publicized recently, there had been more record high temperatures than record low temperatures this past week, even though the numbers were very close (I tried to find the exact numbers, but I could not on company \"x's\" website). The past moths numbers were the same, more record highs than record lows, and this time it wasn't close, record highs far outnumbered record lows. The same went for the past year and the past decade, actually I remember seeing that the ratio for the past decade was very close to 2:1 in favor of the record highs. I'm not sure whether the record temperatures were world-wide, or from the US only. I'll assume the US only, but I'm not sure. Also, catching up with a roommate from college back in Massachusetts named Gerry, a meteorology major also (by the way an absolutely terrific forecaster), asked me \"When is the last time you saw Boston even got close to a wintertime record low?\" I said, excellent question! Even with the cold that Massachusetts experienced recently, was Boston even close to a record low? No, not even close. The coldest they got was on the morning of the 16th at 6 degrees. The record for that date? -7 set in 2004. That year and date, January 16, 2004, is ironic that it came up because it is the ONLY record low temperature set in the winter months (Dec-Feb) of the 21st century at Boston's Logan Airport. Most of the record low temperatures are extremely old (I would estimate that about half are from the 19th century). My point in the last 2 paragraphs? Record highs are more common than record lows, and in my mind, that means something. Simplistically, it means to me that temperature norms are warmer. Since the norms are warmer, a mild air mass in the winter does not have as far to go to set a record high as an arctic air mass does in setting a record low. Thus, more record highs are set than record lows. And that means, in my eyes, that the climate has warmed (ie. global warming). Yes, I am totally ignoring the fact that urban heat islands may have caused localized warming near the reporting stations, and that maybe the stations have moved, and maybe there are different factors (more or less buildings, different geographical factors, etc) that may influence the temperature readings. However, these numbers are, in my mind at least, a strong proof for global warming occurring, at least since records have been kept. --------------UPDATE A response from Marc Morano, Communications Director Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) Inhofe Staff Dear AccuWeather forum participants, Please let me explain the inclusion of Meteorologist Mark Paquette in the Senate Minority report. ( http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.Blogs&ContentRecord_id=2674e64f-802a-23ad-490b-bd9faf4dcdb7&Issue_id= ) I have already privately exchanged notes with Paquette, but I feel it is necessary to publicly explain the detailed and painstaking process and the criteria that was utilized in the report. I want to thank Mark for his cordiality and frankness. First off, let me address how some of the scientists were included. The Senate Report fully explains in the introduction that it \"features their own words, biographies, and weblinks to their peer reviewed studies, scientific analyses and original source materials as gathered from directly from the scientists or from public statements, news outlets, and websites in 2007 and 2008.\" Many of the scientists also contacted us directly and asked to be included. The Senate report of more than 650 dissenting scientists (now approaching 700 scientists as several scientists a week contact us to be added) includes a full range of views on man-made global warming fears. It is not simply \"alarmist\" vs. \"skeptic.\" The Senate report is not a \"list\" of scientists, but a report that includes full biographies of each scientist and their quotes, papers, and links for further reading. The scientists featured in the report express their views in their own words, complete with their intended subtleties and caveats. Many dissenting scientists believe that although mankind may be contributing and/or causing global warming, it is not a \"crisis\" or planetary \"emergency.\" Many scientists featured in the Senate report believe we may have seen all of the warming we are going to get from mankind''s emissions and you cannot distinguish that from natural variability. Many scientists featured in the report accept the idea that mankind is responsible for a significant part of recent warming, but they have serious doubts about future dire predictions of warming. Paquette was also included in the report because of his focus on potential global cooling and his blunt statements questioning the UN IPCC-promoted \"consensus\" that rising CO2 is creating a global warming \"crisis.\" Stating that mankind has contributed to global warming is not the whole story, the key questions are how much impact mankind has had through emissions, land use, deforestation, pavement, etc. Paquette's quotes in the Senate report were in line with many scientists who do not buy the view promoted by Former Vice President Al Gore that CO2 has essentially overwhelmed the natural system and causing runaway global warming. Paquette has said in the comment section of this blog: \"The report never put words in my mouth, and was accurate in they quoted me word by word.\" The statements and points Paquette made over a period of several months were all carefully reviewed and evaluated before he was included in the report. The following specific statements were reviewed and considered before Mark was included in the Senate report: Mark Paquette wrote on November 15, 2008, \"The earth's climate is ridiculously complicated, and carbon dioxide is not the only thing that influences the climate that is changing. In fact, probably EVERYTHING in the earth's climate system changes at one time or another. So, earth's changing climate can not be entirely attributed to carbon dioxide levels rising.\" He also wrote, there are \"many other factors are involved\" than just CO2. \"Yes, an increase in carbon dioxide leads to warming on the planet. This is a very simplistic approach and assumes that nothing else in the climate system changes, and all the warming observed in the earth's climate is directly attributed to the change in the levels of carbon dioxide. As we all know, the assumptions made directly above are not true.\" On November 10, 2008, Mark wrote \"So much is made of20man's role and how he/she affects the climate that often overlooked is the sun's role which is obviously behind all weather (not mention life and everything else) and thus climate on this planet.? Mark continued, \"Previously mentioned in this blog a few months ago is the longer than normal time the sun had gone with a lull in sunspot activity. [...] As mentioned before, a lack of sunspots in the period approximately 1645-1715 (the so-called Maunder Minimum where sunspots were exceedingly rare) is often thought of one of numerous contributing factors in the period of global cooling known as the 'Little Ice Age' where temperatures were cooler around much of the globe.\" Mark also wrote a December 5, 2008, blog entitled \"Permafrost More Resilient Than First Thought?\" \"This discovery of that old ice, and thus Mr. Froese's theory, may put a dent in the run-away global warming thoughts due to carbon dioxide and methane being released when vast areas of permafrost melt.\" In a September 12, 2008 blog, \"Recent Chill could be Start of Longer Term Cooling, says Researcher\", Mark looked at the possibility of global cooling, a concept that it is anathema to the IPCC and Gore. Mark's above-mentioned challenges are against many points of the conventional \"consensus\" are the key reasons he was initially included in the Senate minority report. Finally, any claims that because Paquette was included as a skeptic, it somehow takes away from the Senate 650 plus dissenting scientist report's accuracy -- is countered by the facts. Only a grand total of two scientists have been moved from the main section of the report to the \"non-skeptic\" section noted above since the initial report was released in December 2007. [Note: The two scientists were transferred into that section (neither one requested the move) were moved to more accurately reflect their views and to ensure openness and accountability for the Senate report. Mark Paquette's entry in the Senate report will remain, but the entry will now have an asterisk added next to it and a note explaining this blog post of his and he will no longer be included in the total count of dissenting scientists. This transparent action will ensure that the Senate report continues to be both accurate and accountable to the public. The U.S. Senate Minority Report of more Than 650 International Scientists Dissenting Over Man-Made Global Warming Claims http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.Blogs&ContentRecord_id=2674e64f-802a-23ad-490b-bd9faf4dcdb7&Issue_id= continues to grow almost daily. We have just received a request from an Italian scientist, and a Czech scientist to join the 650 dissenting scientists report. In addition, a former NASA atmospheric scientist and former supervisor of James Han sen has asked to join the dissenters. A chemist from the U.S. Naval Academy is about to be added, and more Japanese scientists are dissenting. Finally, many more meteorologists will be added and another former UN IPCC scientist is about to be included. These scientists are openly rebelling against the climate orthodoxy promoted by Gore and the UN IPCC. Stay tuned... The Senate report is literally redefining the global warming debate.

Antarctica. A new study indicates that Antarctica as a whole is warming, and has been doing so for the past 50 years. \"Antarctica is warming, and it's warming at the same rate as the rest of the planet,\" said study co-author Michael Mann of Penn State University. Mann is also well know for his famous, but controversial \"hockey stick\", which is a plot of the global temperature anomaly over the past 1000 years. Comparing weather station and satellite data, the research team developed a statistical technique to make a new estimate of Antarctica temperature trends. Research does indeed show that the East Antarctic Ice Sheet has been getting colder, which is mainly due to ozone depletion. The results of their work also showed that in addition to the Antarctic Peninsula warming, the interior of West Antarctica was warming as well. How did the authors come to the overall conclusion? The study, funded by the National Science Foundation, found that warming in West Antarctica exceeded about 0.18 degree Fahrenheit (0.1 degree Celsius) per decade for the last 50 years -- more than enough to offset the cooling in East Antarctica, according to the LiveScience article . \"Efforts to repair the ozone layer eventually will begin taking effect and the hole could be eliminated by the middle of this century. If that happens, all of Antarctica could begin warming on a par with the rest of the world,\" said Eric Steig of the University of Washington and lead author of the study. ---------------------- The author(s) of the study have already noted some misleading interpretations of their work in the media and blogosphere and respond with a post on RealClimate.org.

A burned out redwood tree. Tree death rates have increased across a wide variety of forest types, at all elevations, in trees of all sizes, and in pines, firs, hemlocks, and other kinds of trees., according to the U.S.G.S. report . The research team also noted that increasing tree mortality rates mean that western forests could become net sources of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, further speeding up the pace of global warming. A number of other potential causes were ruled out before the researchers concluded that increasing regional temperature was correlated with tree deaths. The causes that were ruled out were air pollution, long-term effects from fire supression and normal forest dynamics. The greater than one degree F. increase in temperature over the western U.S. over the past few decades has been enough to reduce winter snowpack, cause earlier snowmelt, and lengthen the summer drought, according to Phil van Mantgem, a USGS scientist. Drought is also stressing the trees and the warming has allowed diseases and insects such as tree-killing bark beetles to thrive. This study was posted in this month's online edition of Science.

Scientists have been charting the decline in snowpacks over the western U.S. in recent decades with the Cascade Mountain Range experiencing a 60% drop in average snowpack over the past 50 years, according to the LiveScience article . The results of the study showed that soot, which by the way, is generated by the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and diesel engines can warm up the snow and air above it by up to 0.7 degrees celsius (1.2F). Similar to what is also happening in parts of the Arctic region, the soot darkens the snow, causing it to absorb more of the sun's energy. This leads to more melting earlier in the spring, which means less runoff water from snowmelt is available in the crucial late spring and summer period. Last year, our own Mike Smith performed an interesting soot/snow experiment in his back yard using fireplace ash. You can check it out right here.

The team of scientists measured the annual abundances of bacteria trapped in ice over the past 70 years. Their analysis showed that bacterial levels rose with higher temperatures and dust concentrations. The lowest concentrations of bacteria were from 1938, while the highest concentrations were from 1997. The concentrations increased in accordance with the oxygen-18 isotope, which in itself has been shown to increase in concentration in warmer years.

First, here is their December global anomaly map..... I did not see any of the specific numbers for the month, but I will continue to look. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The year 2008. The base period from 1951-1980 was used to determine the global temperature anomalies. --2008 was the coolest year since 2000, which is supported by other methods. (+0.44). --2008 was the 9th warmest year since records were kept back to 1880. When considering the margin of uncertainty, GISS is confident that 2008 was somewhere between the 7th and 10th warmest year on record. --The ten warmest years all occurred from 1997-2008. GISS states that comparing the 2008 chart below left with the mean 2001-2007 anomalies clearly shows why 2008 was the coolest since 2000. The main differences between the two charts is in the Pacific. Note: the cooling in the Pacific during 2008 and also over North America. ----------------------- GISS also responds to questions about their prediction from last year which stated that a new global temperature record was likely within the next 2-3 years (now, the next 1-2 years). According to GISS, there are several factors to consider when making this prediction....... 1. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). History says that a prolonged La Nina is unlikely for 2009/2010 despite the trends over the past few months. The subsurface of the Pacific in their opinion appears recharged for the next El Nino and there is a good chance for an El Nino in 2009 or 2010. Note; There is usually a 3-6 month lag in global temperature response to a change in ENSo conditions. 2. Solar Irradiance. Most solar physicists expect the irradiance to begin to pick up in the next several months after a longer than normal period of low solar output. Even if the irradiance does pick up, the 1-2 year lag in any surface temperature response to the cycle means that solar irradiance will continue to provide a negative anomaly for the next 2-3 years. 3. Volcanic aerosols. 4. Greenhouse gases (GHG's). The latest GHG forcing trend translates into a mean warming rate of ~0.15 Celsius per decade. Updated prediction from GISS .......It still seems likely that a new global temperature record will be set within the next 1-2 years, despite the moderate negative effect of the reduced solar irradiance.

It's actually the cool phase of the PDO or what scientists call the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The cool phase of the PDO, which is a large, long-lived pattern of climate variability in the Pacific associated with a general cooling of Pacific waters recently made its return. Based on the PDO index from the University of Washington, the Pacific has been consistently under the cool phase of the PDO since the end of last year. There was a lot of variability going back to 1999, while much of the 1980's and 1990's saw the warm phase. The PDO is a long term oscillation which can last anywhere from 5 to 20 years! Check out the latest sea-surface height measurements from the U.S./French Jason-1 oceanography satellite below........ In the image, places where the Pacific sea-surface height is higher (warmer) than normal are yellow and red, and places where the sea surface is lower (cooler) than normal are blue and purple. Green shows where conditions are near normal. Sea-surface height is an indicator of the heat content of the upper ocean. Sea-surface temperature satellite data from NOAA shown below also supports the Jason sea-surface height analysis in showing the classic cool phase of the PDO> \"The present cool phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation will have significant implications for shifts in marine ecosystems, and for land temperature and rainfall patterns around the Pacific basin\", said Bill Patzert, an oceanographer and climatologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. \"Even with the strong La Niña event fading in the tropics last spring, the North Pacific's sea surface temperature anomaly pattern has remained strongly negative since last fall. This cool phase will likely persist this winter and, perhaps, beyond\", said Nathan Mantua of the Climate Impacts Group at the University of Washington, Seattle. According to Mantua, the cool phase of the PDO argues against abundant winter/spring precipitation in the southwestern U.S, which includes southern California. The region has been pretty dry recently, but the significant storm this past Wednesday did bring some relief to the region in the form of rain and heavy mountain snow.

Better yet, maybe we should stick to the NASA and IPCC approved global climate change. (see my blog over this past weekend regarding terminology). According to the Reuters article , the odds of a \"white Christmas\" are rapidly diminishing in places like Oslo, Norway. Oddsmakers in Britain even place bets on whether or not there will be a \"white Christmas\" at a particular location. Hmm....Maybe I should get in on that action. Those odds have got to be awfully long for London. The U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center has satellite data collected since 1978 showing northern hemisphere snow cover for the March-April period has declined by about 2 million square km (772,300 sq mile) to 36 million square km. (From the Reuters article). Snowlovers should not get too concerned. Gerhard Mueller-Wetermeier, a German climatologist noted that there will be plenty of snow in many temperate zones for decades to come with little noticeable change. Also, keep in mind, warmer air can hold more moisture and in northern temperate zones, including higher elevations this could certainly translate to more snowfall. Below is our latest U.S. prediction for snow cover on Christmas Day. If this prediction ends up fairly accurate then the areal coverage of snow (trace or more) in the Lower 48 would actually be above the normal. Also, I read that this may end up being the first year since 1971 that all of Canada has a \"white Christmas\". I personally think it will be about 99.5% of the country, as some of the immediate southern coastal areas of Atlantic Canada and western Vancouver Island may end up green/brown.

Satellite data over the past two years shows the world's major ice sheets melting much more rapidly than previously thought, and based on this new information the global sea level rise by 2100 could be as much as 4 feet, according to the report. The earlier report from IPCC estimated a 1.5 foot sea level rise by 2100, but that report did not factor in the lubrication under the ice sheet.

Cosmic rays. Image courtesy of NASA. Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on board satellites, the researchers from Norway and Iceland determined that cosmic rays most likely do not contribute to climate change, since the effect of cosmic rays on clouds is too small to have that much impact. According to the Laser Focus World article , this particular research is supported by some earlier findings. The team used observations from so-called Forbush decrease events during the study. These events are sudden outbreaks of intense solar activity that lead to a strong reduction of cosmic rays, lasting for a couple of days. The researchers have identified 22 such events between 2000 and 2005. Previous studies have mainly considered cloud cover, but the high spatial and spectral resolution of the MODIS data also allows for a more in depth study of microphysical parameters such as cloud droplet size, cloud water content and cloud optical depth.

The article also mentions other terminology that you may not have heard of before. The most popular (at least with the media)....Global warming --First mentioned in a 1975 science article titled ' Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?', by geochemist Wallace Broecker. --The popular use of this term exploded (especially in the media) starting in 1988 when Dr. James Hansen testified to congress about climate concerns. Inadvertent Climate Modification --This term was used during most of the 1970's because scientists did not know if the future direction of climate modificate was up or down, since man-made aerosols might cause cooling. --This term was basically abandoned in 1979. Climate Change --In 1979, the Charney Report, written by Jule Charney of MIT used the global warming term when referring to surface temperature change, but when discussing other changes that were induced by increasing atmospheric CO2 he used the term climate change. Within scientific journals, this is still how the two terms are used. Global warming refers to surface temperature increases, while climate change includes global warming and everything else that increasing greenhouse gas amounts will affect. Global Change --Originated in the late 1980's, but never caught on. Global Climate Change --Currently used by NASA and the IPCC. --A more scientifically accurate term according to NASA and IPCC.

John Valley of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and collegues studied stalactites from a cave near Jerusalem. Using a new instrument called an ion microprobe, Valley and his team were able to see much more finer detail within the \"rings\" of the stalactites, which basically contain a historical record of rainfall climate in the region from 200 B.C to 1100 A.D. The ion microprobe allows the team to break down the stalactite data by a single year, or even separate seasons, as opposed to centuries. \"The advantage of the ion microprobe is it allows us to analyze samples that are a million to a billion times smaller than we could in the past,\" said Valley. The new tool allowed the team to construct the climate record year by year during the time the Roman and Byzantine empires were struggling to survive.

However, I did find this interesting article from www.dailycamera.com. Knowing our commentors here at AccuWeather, so the first thing I know I'll read from you is \"But we do not even know that global warming is occurring\" but let's get past this point and just read, enjoy, and then please comment on this article. -I think a couple of points in this article makes are interesting. First, it mentions that it might be more appropriate to say that the increase in greenhouse gases are warming the oceans, and the oceans are what are causing climate change. I never really thought of it that way. So, the ocean might have more to do with our climate than the atmosphere. Hmmm.... -Also, it mentions that the ocean obviously goes through natural cycles of temperature site on its own (ie. El Nino, La Nina). We can obviously see how these natural cycles affect the earth's climate temporarily, so it makes sense to me to say that the ocean plays a huge role in the earth's climate, and it will affect the climate if ocean temperatures rise. -Another point the article makes is how scientists are trying to improve the models dealing with ocean temperatures. Good luck with that! From seeing how bad such weather forecasting models such as the NAM,GFS,ECMWF,etc. have done with the east coast storm that just ripped up the coast late last week, I know how much these computer models need to be improved. I'll assume the ocean temperature models need to be improved dramatically as well. I have no idea how to do this, but I wish all the programmers much luck.

According to the AP article , Brennan made this statement at a briefing on the nation's climate since 1951. But, according to Martin Hoerling of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory, no change in temperature has occurred since 1951 in the center of the U.S., in what Hoerling describes as sort of a \"warming hole\". Overall, surface temperatures over the United States have increased 1.6 F since 1951, with most of that warming taking place over the past 30 years. The NOAA officials also noted that November 2008 was 2.0 degrees above normal for the contiguous U.S. and that this past month was the warmest November on record in the western states.

Jacobson says that energy from the wind, water and sun are the best ways to improve energy security, mitigate global warming and reduce air pollution deaths, as opposed to biofuels, nuclear and \"clean coal\". Wind was the most promising energy source, leading to a better than 99% reduction in carbon and air pollution emissions. Jacobson said that while some people are under the impression that wind and wave power are too variable to provide steady amounts of electricity, his research group has already shown in previous research that by properly coordinating the energy output from wind farms in different locations, the potential problem with variability can be overcome and a steady supply of baseline power delivered to users, according to the EurekAlert release . Jacobson said that biofuels are the most damaging choice to move away from fossil fuels. He found cellulosic ethanol was worse than corn ethanol because it results in more air pollution, requires more land to produce and causes more damage to wildlife. \"Clean coal\" is not clean at all, according to Jacobson, and it is likely that if the United States were to move more heavily into nuclear power, then other nations would demand to be able to use that option. Also, which has been disussed in this blog, both coal and nuclear energy plants take much longer to plan, permit and construct than do most of the other new recommended energy sources The result would be even more emissions from existing nuclear and coal power sources as people continue to use comparatively \"dirty\" electricity while waiting for the new energy sources to come online, Jacobson said. Electric power sources rated best to worst by Jacobson's evaluation 1. Wind power. 2. Concentrated solar power. 3. Geothermal power. 4. Tidal power. 5. Solar photovoltaics. 6. Wave power. 7. Hydroelectric power. 8. Nuclear power and \"clean coal\" (tie). Note: Jacobson received no funding from any interest group, company or government agency.

Irish scientist John Tyndall first speculated that man-made global warming might be possible way back in 1861, the year the American Civil War began. Svante Arrhennius, a nobel prize winning chemist confirmed climate change using pencil and paper calculations by the end of the 19th century, according to the article .

The Southern Ocean Earlier studies suggested that the Southern Ocean carbon sink was saturated and could no longer keep up with the increasing amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Based on the results of the study, it is determined that Southern Ocean currents, and therefore the Southern Ocean's ability to soak up carbon dioxide, have not changed in recent decades despite the significant increase in wind. Southern Ocean warming up Using measurements from a network of ocean robots and comparing that data to historical ship data, the team found that the Southern Ocean was found to be warmer and fresher since the 1960's, and according to CSIRO's Dr. Steve Rintoul, this is a pattern consistent with the 'fingerprint' of climate change from man-made carbon emissions. Deep water The team also found no evidence of a change in the amount of deep water rising to the surface near Antarctica. The fact that the upwelling of deep water has not changed is important. Deep water is very rich in carbon dioxide and so an increase in upwelling tends to transfer carbon dioxide from the ocean to the atmosphere. The low-resolution models used for climate forecasts predict stronger winds, which cause stronger upwelling and therefore less carbon dioxide being stored in the ocean, according to the CSIRO media release .

When I first encountered this story my first reaction was \"yea right!\" \"Who came up with this study?\" After reading the article, I can see how a massive deployment of wind farms could alter local weather, in terms of surface wind, but I still find it hard to believe that they could steer storms and change global weather patterns. The story via LiveScience............. A group of scientists from the University of Maryland based their calculations from the study on the idea that all land from Texas to central Canada and from the Great Lakes to the Rocky Mountains were covered in one massive wind farm. My first thought.............that is one big eye sore. Anyway, through their calculations they determied that this massive deployment of wind farms would slow wind speeds 5 or 6 mph. This would cause waves to radiate across the northern hemisphere and alter storm tracks. I find that hard to believe, especially since large scale storms are mostly directed by powerful, upper-level (25,000-30,000 feet up) jet stream winds. Those wind turbines would have to be insanely tall to have any effect in my opinion, and I am not talking those 300 footers either, not even close! But, as I kept reading I found that the scientists from this study admit that this great expanse of wind farms is highly unlikely to ever occur (no kidding!). They do feel that if we go by the Department of Energy projections, which say that 20% of our electricity will come from the wind by 2030 that some altering of the weather could still happen. In 2004, David Keith of the University of Calgary and his colleagues estimated the drag from wind farms if they covered 10 percent of the Earth's land surface. They concluded that global cooling would occur in polar regions and global warming would result in temperate regions such as North America at about 30 degrees North latitude. Ten percent of the Earth's land surface is still a very small part of the earth when you add in all the ocean area, so I find the results of this earlier study a bit of a stretch as well.

Well, this week I found a doozy, right out of a science fiction novel! In this article posted on the website thefutureofthings.com, researchers at the University of Arizona are developing a space sunshade system that could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the earth by 2%, enough they say to balance the heating effects of the increasing amount of greenhouses gases in the atmosphere. I won't get into details of the article, since you can read it for yourself. However, some questions that I immediately came up with and hopefully you the readers can read and comment on: -Is this program or any idea like this worth the cost? We can't even agree whether or not global warming is/will occurr(ing), and we still debate if the earth is warming or cooling. I think alot more research needs to be done on the climate system before seriously pondering something like this. -Don't get me wrong, I think looking into and researching programs, ideas and experiments like this is great, and it may be one day necessary to implement something like this, so why not be prepared? But are their more immediate concerns that these talented researchers can be using their time and money on? -If something like this would ever come to fruition, what kind of battles would this start, both scientifically and politically? Think about, the US launches this systems and shades, say, Brazil. What kind of changes happen to say Brazil's farmlands, or even their tourism? Basically, who plays \"God\" and determines where, when and how many of the shades or put into orbit? Thought you might find this article interesting....

The loss of forest land across parts of the globe, but specifically the Amazon region of Brazil is one of the keys to the steady increase in global atmospheric carbon dioxide as stored carbon from these old jungles is released into the atmoshere as it is destroyed. Around 20% of global CO2 emissions due to human activities are from tropical deforestation and land use change. According to the Physorg.com article , Brazil's Amazon jungles have lost 4,800 sq. miles during a 12-month period from 2007 to 2008, which is about the size of Connecticut. This loss is about a 4% increase over the previous 12-month period. The primary reason for this loss is the continuous encroachment of farms which tend to produce soya beans. Amazon forest burning. There is some good news, Brazil has been able to sharply reduce the loss of Amazon rainforests over the past 3 years, according to the article, but there is still a lot more that needs to be done to prevent loss.

The Arctic is mostly a semi-enclosed ocean that is surrounded by land, while the Antarctic is a large land mass that is surrounded by large oceans. The sea ice in the Arctic is not as mobile and a lot of it remains in the colder waters of the Arctic into the summer, while in the Antarctic, the sea ice can move around much more freely and much more of it can melt compared to the Arctic since it is free to float into the warmer waters farther to the north since there are no land barriers in the way. The Arctic Ocean is mostly covered by ice and surrounded by land, precipitation is relatively rare. Snowfall tends to be low, except near the ice edge. Antarctica, however, is entirely surrounded by ocean, so moisture is more readily available. Antarctic sea ice tends to be covered by thicker snow compared to the Arctic.

Speaking of El Nino and La Nina, here is the latest sea surface temperature anomaly for the globe as of December 2nd. Image courtesy of the NCDC. After looking at the image a couple things stand out..... 1. Temperature anomalies in the equatorial Pacific which is the key area for El Nino (warming) and La Nina (cooling), we can see that much of that area is either at or very slightly below-normal, which supports the current neutral phase. 2. Much of the oceans in the southern hemisphere over the past few years have been cooler than normal, but now we are seeing larger areas of above-normal anomalies showing up. Will that continue? Tough to say at this point. 3. Note the significant cold anomaly just south of Alaska and the warm one east of Newfoundland. According to the latest ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) update from NOAA, the current phase is neutral, but atmospheric and oceanic features mildly reflect the colder phase of ENSO (La Nina), but the official indicator still falls short of the La Nina threshold. The latest Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) was right on 0.0 during the latest three month period from August to October. To be classified an El Nino (positive ONI greater than or equal to +0.5) or La Nina (negative ONI less than or equal to -0.5) thes thresholds must be exceeded for a period of at least 5 consecutive overlapping 3-month seasons.

In the experiment there were two plots of grass. Half of each plot was heavily fertilized, while the other halves received low doses of fertilizer. At the same time, one of the plots was heated up by an additional 6 degrees F.

(Fertilizer had no effect on it.) In contrast to fescue and most other crop plants, crabgrass and many other weeds photosynthesize with greater efficiency the warmer it gets, so they have been predicted to proliferate as temperatures rise, according to the LiveScience article .

The National Snow and Ice Data Center's (NSIDC) Mark Serreze in a recent abstract noted that model-projected Arctic Amplification is focused over the Arctic Ocean and as the climate warms the summer melt season lengthens and intensifies.

Pacala, codirectors of the Carbon Mitigation Initiative at Princeton have developed the ?stabilization wedge? theory designed to cap carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere at current levels. The two scientists state that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide could be fought with a series of individual responses, each designed to remove one ?wedge? from the graph showing rising CO2 levels. The wedges include the following, according to the Providence Journal article .... --Improved energy efficiency --Remove carbon emissions from electric power production --Reduce methane emissions --Plant more trees and other vegetation --Replace gas powered vehicles with electric ones Dr. Socolow, in response to Dr. James Hansen's global warming claim that the world is fast approaching a point of no return, stated that global warming is a risk management problem , not a threshold problem . Socolow said he still believes there is some headroom that would allow for more CO2 increases, but the only ethical thing to do would be for developed countries to cap or reduce their emissions, so the poorest countries have some space to grow and create more emissions of their own. People in developed countries should be limited to 4 or 5 tons of CO2 annually, Socolow said. But it takes very little to reach that level. You could do it by driving an economy car 10,000 miles or flying 10,000 miles a year or heating one house. ------------------------------ That last paragraph is interesting. I calculated my individual carbon footprint at the Nature Conservancy site . I drive a Honda Civic (36 mpg) about 12,000 miles a year, hardly ever fly and heat one house. I also do several things in my household to be energy efficient and my estimated carbon footprint (tons of CO2 released a year) was still 19! This number is still below the U.S. average of 27, but not even close to what Socolow says it would be. I think he needs to take another look at the carbon footprint test.

So, I figured I'd look at the most heard about atmospheric component dealing with climate change (especially in the media) carbon dioxide levels. According to this article I found surfing the web, in September, 2008 the carbon dioxide level, as measured from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, was 383.09 parts per million. As most of you already know, and is mentioned in this article, the carbon dioxide pre-industrial levels were around 280 parts per million, so man is thought to be responsible for an addition of 100 parts per million in the last 150-200 years. -As was commented about my blog last week, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. An increase in a greenhouse gas leads to warming, right? Simple answer, in my opinion, is yes. A more complicated answer, and one that seems to be most accepted by most of the commenters, is not necessarily, as the earth's climate system is very complex. -The simple answer is yes, an increase in carbon dioxide leads to warming on the planet. This is a very simplistic approach and assumes that nothing else in the climate system changes, and all the warming observed in the earth's climate is directly attributed to the change in the levels of carbon dioxide. -As we all know, the assumptions made directly above are not true. The earth's climate is ridiculously complicated, and carbon dioxide is not the only thing that influences the climate that is changing. In fact, probably EVERYTHING in the earth's climate system changes at one time or another. So, earth's changing climate can not be entirely attributed to carbon dioxide levels rising. -Below is just my opinion, and please comment on it. The increase in carbon dioxide levels will, by itself and no other changes in the climate system, lead to warming in the earth's atmosphere. However, this warming may or may not be seen in actuality. It may be hidden, or masked, by factors that are cooling the climate. On the other hand, if warming of the climate is shown to be occurring, the increase in carbon dioxide levels are playing a role in this warming, but are not entirely responsible for all of the warming as many other factors are involved.

Soils are the world's largest source of CO2 (10 times more each year than from all human CO2 emissions combined). What does all of this mean? From the Cornell Chronicle story ...... As a result of global warming, soils are expected to release more carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere, which, in turn, creates more warming. Climate models try to incorporate these increases of carbon dioxide from soils as the planet warms, but results vary greatly when realistic estimates of black carbon in soils are included in the predictions, the study found. By entering the Australian black carbon data into the models the researchers found that the predicted CO2 emissions from soil was reduced 20% over a period of 100 years compared to previous model simulations, which in their opinion failed to account for the long shelf life of black carbon. To sum it up, it appears that black carbon's stability in soil has been underestimated and that the results of these findings indicate that global warming predictions from computer simulations has been overestimated.

Water vapor, which is the earth's most abundant greenhouse gas has been confirmed by researchers from Texas A&M as a major player in global warming and potent enough to double the climate warming caused by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The team used data from atmospheric infrared sounder on satellites to measure precisely the humidity throughout the lowest 10 miles of the atmosphere. That information was combined with global observations of shifts in temperature, allowing researchers to build a comprehensive picture of the interplay between water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other atmosphere-warming gases, according to the report on EurekAlert.

A blog I posted a few weeks back mentioned how most scientists believe that an increase in low cloud cover may cause a net cooling in the atmosphere because of an increased albedo, while an increase in high clouds may cause the atmosphere to warm, as high clouds act as a \"blanket\" and reflect infrared radiation back to the earth. This article from the Thaindian News reports how a reduction in cloud cover could have contributed to an increase in temperature, a decrease in precipitation, thus causing a decrease in global plant growth, which in turn led to fewer cloud condensation nuclei, which led to fewer clouds, which in turn led to.... well you get the picture, repeat from the beginning of the sentence. Basically, it is a positive feedback loop which leads to less cloud cover and higher temperatures and lower precipitation amounts. - That gets me thinking about something I had read earlier, I forget where, that changes in any part of the earth's climate system are important, but often more important is what type of feedback mechanisms are set in place by the initial change. -So, the questions to ask ourselves, when we talk about climate change, are what changes in the climate system are occurring (it doesn't matter if they are natural or man-made), how are these changes going to affect the climate, and possibly more important ...what feedback mechanisms will be set in motion, and will this feedback set another one in motion...etc... sort of like knocking down one domino in a row of many...

An Exerpt from the EurekAlert release ....... The authors say that improved data on past climate changes, and the pace at which earth is changing now, especially in the polar regions, contributed to their conclusion. Among other things, ongoing observations of fast-melting ice masses that previously helped reflect solar radiation, and the release of stored-up \"greenhouse\" gases from warming soils and ocean waters, show that feedback processes previously thought to move slowly can occur within decades, not millennia, and thus warm the world further. Once CO2 gas is released, a large fraction of it stays in the air for hundreds of years.

The Washington Times reports that Canadian researchers have been recently studying 700,000 year old ice wedges buried in soil 10 feet underground in the Yukon Territory. According to professor Duane Froese of the University of Alberta, these ice wedges are the oldest in North America and have been able to survive earlier periods of global warming. How do they know that? Froese and his team were able to fisson date it since the ice was buried under a layer of volcanic ash. This means the ice was older than the ash and older than the previous record holder - 120,000-year-old ice wedges found in Alaska. \"The fact that this ice survived the interglacials about 120,000 and 400,000 years ago, which we think were warmer than present, really illustrates how stubborn permafrost can be in the face of climate warming,\" Mr. Froese said. How did this particular permafrost ice survive the hundreds of thousands of years of warming, cooling and warming? Brian Moorman, professor of geography at the University of Calgary suggests that the ash covering and shadows protected the ice from the thaw. Mr. Moorman said that global warming models and grids do not take into account all the complexities of regional variations on the planet, but they are improving. However, the professor notes that 2007 and 2008 have shown a slight reduction in global temperature averages and that low sunspot activity also point to near-term cooling periods, according to the Times.

When the algae dies, it descends to the bottom of the ocean with the carbon. With fears of recession and amid the deepest financial crisis since the 1930s, some governments may find cheap geo-engineering attractive compared with reducing carbon emissions. \"It would be short-sighted,\" said Terry Barker, head of the Cambridge Centre for Climate Change Mitigation Research. The seas are already suffering enough from a \"chemical soup\" of pollution from humans, he said. \"There's no need to add to the mess.\" --Spraying smoke of tiny particles of pollutants into the sky to dim sunlight. --Putting sulphur particles into the upper atmosphere to reflect some sunlight back to space. --Spew more sea spray into the atmosphere, making low-level clouds more whiter (higher albedo). --But here's the winner!

While discussing the subject of climate change, so much is made of man's role and how he/she affects the climate that often overlooked is the sun's role, which is obviously behind all weather (not mention life and everything else) and thus climate on this planet. Previously mentioned in this blog a few months ago is the longer than normal time the sun had gone with a lull in sunspot activity. Most of us are aware of the normal 11 year cycle of sunspot activity (see graph below). This cycle reached its peak in 2001, and its next peak is expected in 2012. Thus, sunspots were at a minimum in the 2006-2007 time period, which was observed. However, scientists this summer were slightly puzzled as to why the lack of sunspot continued longer than expected. As can be seen in this report , sunspot activity has picked up slightly from this summer, as it should be in keeping with the normal, expected behavior of the sun. -As well as an increase in sunspots, there comes an slight increase in other solar activity, including the output of energy in the form of solar radiation, which warms the earth. So, since it looks like the sunspot cycle is, or will soon be, on the normal, expected path, the earth's temperature should not be affected due to a unexpected change in the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth. -As mentioned before, a lack of sunspots in the period approximately 1645-1715 (the so called Maunder Minimum where sunspots were exceedingly rare) is often thought of one of numerous contributing factors in the period of global cooling known as the \"Little Ice Age\" where temperatures were cooler around much of the globe. Cooling started before the Maunder Minimum began, so what role the lack of sunspots played in global cooling is debatable. This cooling is most noticeable in northwest Europe, where the Thames River in London froze thick enough to have \"winter carnivals\" on the ice and crops, ie. vineyards, did not advance as far north as they do now. -Obviously, with the advancement of society in this region and more numerous records here as compared to other places in the world, any cooling would be more noticeable in this area. -Just something to keep an eye on in the near future is whether or not the number of sunspots follow the general increase in number until 2012. If so, no deviance from slight increase in the solar output is expected. If some sort of variance from the norm is noticed, then climate change may be affected by this entirely natural factor.

Man is indeed the primary source for methane emissions (around 60-70%), but natural sources can certainly play a role in the increase in atmospheric methane and this has already been accounted for by climate change scientists in the IPCC. Here is the link to the actual MIT story from their website, and I cannot find anywhere in the actual MIT story where it says that this study contradicts a methane climate change theory. The scientific team from MIT believe that the 2007 increase was partly caused by warming over Siberia, resulting in an increase in emissions from wetlands. In order to achieve this simultaneously global increase there needed to be a methane increase from the southern hemisphere. The teams best answer is that there was a drop in methane destroying hydroxyl in the southern hemisphere, but they are still not sure and further study is needed. Key point from the MIT article...... \"The key thing is to better determine the relative roles of increased methane emission versus an decrease in the rate of removal,\" Prinn (co-author of the study) said. \"Apparently we have a mix of the two, but we want to know how much of each\" is responsible for the overall increase. Natural sources of methane emission are primarily from wetlands and insects (about 30% of the total). I thank Mike Kaulbars for bringing attention to this. You can read his take on this story right here on his Greenfyre blog . ------------------------------- My original blog is below......... Atmospheric chemistry scientists from MIT have discovered that the world-wide increase in methane levels during 2007, which by the way was the first in 10 years, occurred siimultaneously, which would contradict theories that man is the primary source for significant increases. According to the article from Tgdaily, it normally takes about 1-year got man-made gases generated in the more industrialized northern hemisphere to reach the southern hemisphere, but the methane levels recorded in this study rose simultaneously in the same year, indicating that this increase in methane may be part of a natural cycle. The scientists caution that more study is still needed since 2007 is long gone and much of that data may not be that relevant during 2008. There was an update to this report. A number of people wondered if the massive Siberian permafrost meltoff in 2007 was responsible. The authors disputed that saying that this episode was a northern hemisphere event and would still require the normal 1-year cycling to reach the southern hemisphere.

Brett. ------------------ I just finished reading this excellent article from NASA's Earth Observatory, which is titled \"Correcting Ocean Cooling\". In the article, Josh Willis, a scientist from the Jet Propulsion Lab describes in detail how a follow-up study of his on ocean heat content showed a surprisingly large, unexplained decrease in ocean heat content in the Atlantic from 2003 to 2006. Some of the media and web sites picked this up back then and concluded that global warming was not real. But, Josh did not trust his data and dug hard for more answers as any good scientist should do. Through his hard work, Josh determined that there were errors in the Argo and XBT (bathythermograph) data. Some of the new Argo data was too cold and some of the older XBT sensor data was too warm. In short, when the bad data was taken out the ocean cooling went away. The graphics from NASA below show the results of corrected data.... After applying a correction, the historical record shows a relatively steady increase (ocean heat content) in line with what?s shown by climate models. The remaining short-term variability is as likely to be natural variation, such as El Niño, as noise in the data. The corrections made to this data impacted many other results from other studies including narrowing the gap between calculated and observed sea level rise. \"What we found was that ocean heating was larger than scientists previously thought, and so the contribution of thermal expansion to sea level rise was actually 50 percent larger than previous estimates,\" said Catia Domingues, a CISRO scientist. I like this last paragraph....... \"Models are not perfect,\" says Syd Levitus. \"Data are not perfect. Theory isn?t perfect. We shouldn?t expect them to be. It?s the combination of models, data, and theory that lead to improvements in our science, in our understanding of phenomena.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"882b7418002b0b5c1e553185851685db2f68ee6c"}

Here is a new study that could restore lost confidence in temperature modeling, at least in the tropics. Brett. Computer model simulated changes in surface temperature and sea-ice extent from 1919-2099. Image courtesy of LLNL. Using state-of-the-art observational datasets and results from computer model simulations archived at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL researchers and colleagues from 11 other scientific institutions have refuted a recent claim from last year that simulated temperature trends (modeling) in the tropics are fundamentally inconsistent with observations. LLNL's Benjamin Santer and his international team of scientists found that there is no fundamental discrepancy between modeled and observed trends in tropical temperatures. There are two main reasons for this reconciliatation, as reported by NASA's Earth Observatory article ........... First, the analysis that reported disagreement between models and observations had applied an inappropriate statistical test, which did not account for the statistical uncertainty in observed warming trends. This uncertainty arises because the human-caused component of recent temperature changes is not perfectly known in any individual observed time series ? it must be estimated from data that are influenced by both human effects and the \"noise\" of natural climate variability. Examples of such \"noise\" include large El Niño and La Niña events, which have pronounced effects on the year-to-year variability of tropical temperatures. The second reason for the reconciliation of models and observations was the availability of new and improved observational datasets, both for surface and tropospheric temperatures. The developers of these datasets used different procedures to identify and adjust for biases (such as those caused by changes over time in the instruments and platforms used to measure temperature). Here is a link to the new study abstract, which will be posted in the International Journal of Climate. I was unable to find the link to the previous study which stated that the modeling was inconsistent with the observations. Update : It has been pointed out to me that Steve McIntyre of Climate Audit has been ripping into Santer's study. Here is the link . It is very technical and difficult to follow, unless you are great with statisical analysis and equations. Time for a laugh I realize this has been out for a while, but I just found this Frank Caliendo impersonation of Al Gore and his movie on YouTube . If you haven't seen it, check it out.

As of right now, the ENSO is still considered in a neutral state.

Seems like we here at Accuweather are not the only people obsessed with beating Ohio State in football!! Seriously, though, this, like I mentioned above, quasi-humorous article brings up a point near and dear to many of us with many of us being nature-lovers, how does wildlife adjust to global warming? (Assuming that global warming does/is occurring of course). -Though Michiganites are \"worried\" about the Buckeye tree moving north and \"invading\" Michigan, there are legitimate concerns about how other wildlife adjusts to changing temperature and precipitation patterns. I think many of us have heard about the plight of polar bears starving to death and having to swim longer distances than they have had to in the past to find food due to the shrinkage of the polar ice cap. -Personally, one huge interest of mine, besides meteorology obviously, is the study of herpetology which is the study of amphibians and reptiles. I have a particular interest in snakes, and getting more particular, rattlesnakes. How does climate change affect these animals home range? Are they able to slowly expand north into areas where they are not found now? How does this affect the people that live there? -We can ask this not only about animals, but of plants as well. Plants can not migrate north or south, obviously, so how do they adjust to a changing climate? Do plants benefit from a longer growing season? Or do some areas become drier and plants don't do as well there? Do deserts and other climate zones move? (ie. the Sahara moving south in Africa) -Often times we think about how climate change may affect human beings, and not think much about how other living things may be affected.

You can read more about how this happens from the NASA . The destruction of ozone has caused the Antarctic stratosphere to be cooler than it would normally be in the summer and fall. Models and observations indicate that the cooling intensifies the vortex of winds that isolate frigid Antarctic air from warmer air from lower latitudes. Ozone-hole-related cooling may be the reason why interior Antarctica has not warmed up as fast as most of the rest of the planet due to global warming, according to the article .

The sounder measures the infrared light emitted by CO2 to produce the maps. The study shows how CO2 is distributed in the atmosphere and how it moves around the globe. The distribution of CO2 was found to be influenced by the following..... --Major surface sources of CO2. --Large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (jet stream, high and low pressure areas). There were major differences in CO2 concentration from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere (much more ocean area).

Acid Rain and Warming are Good for Forests 4/19/2010, 7:56:47 AM Growing up in the Northeast in the 1970's and early 80's, the big environmental concern that I (Brett) recall being disussed on a regular basis was acid rain, and how it was destroying our forests. Now, this new study from Michigan's Technological University comes out with this........ According to the ScienceDaily article , the research team found that moderate increases in temperature and nitrogen from atmospheric pollution (results in acid rainfall) actually improve forest productivity. The testing took place at four different sites and has been ongoing since 1987. Andrew Burton, an associate professor at Michigan Tech and head of the National Institute for Climatic Change Research's Midwestern Regional Center found that the trees grow faster at higher temperatures and store more carbon at greater concentrations of nitrogen, a chemical constituent of acid rain, providing there is sufficient moisture. The team also determined that the rise in temperature has extended the growing season in Michigan by 10 to 11 days on average, which is significant in that region. The research, which started out as an acid rain study in 1987, has grown into one of the longest continuous research studies supported by the National Science Foundation. A new five-year grant of $151,628 will fund the research through 2012. By the way, there has been a steady decline in nitrogen oxide emissions this decade. I have a question, though. This may very well be the case in Michigan, but from what I recall, the concentrations of acid rain have been typically higher in the upper Ohio Valley and into the Northeast and the sensitivity of the forests to acid rain in the Northeast have usually been higher as well, so, could the results of this study not be valid in the Northeast?

The Anchorage Daily News posted an interesting story a couple of days ago about the impact of the 2007-2008 winter on some of the glaciers across the state. High snowfall during the winter followed by a cool summer resulted in the largest buildup of snow on the Juneau Icefield since 1946. It was a similar situation on a lot of other glaciers as well, according to the article. \"It's been a long time on most glaciers where they've actually had positive mass balance,\" said Bruce Molina, a glaciologist from the U.S. Geological Survey. Mass balance is the difference between how much snow falls every winter and how much snow fades away each summer. For most Alaska glaciers, the summer snow loss has for decades exceeded the winter snowfall. One cool summer that leaves 20 feet of new snow still sitting atop glaciers come the start of the next winter is no big deal, Molnia said. Ten summers like that? Well, that might mark the start of something like the Little Ice Age. Climate is constantly shifting. And even if the past year was a signal of a changing future, Molnia said, it would still take decades to make itself noticeable in Alaska's glaciers.

According to the Telegraph article , the Italian Meteorological Society has observed less gold, red and copper colored foliage across the nation's woodlands. Similar developments have been noted elsewhere in Europe and in the northern Hemisphere. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has just started funding a study into claims that the northern states fall colors are also fading away with climate change. \"Something is clearly happening to make the colours less vivid. The wood is a living organism that tries to adapt to the climate, and change in climate is the cause. We really need to study and understand what's happening, said Dr. Giustino Mezzalira, an Italian forest expert. \"But I think that, as in the United States, the colours are fading because the temperature difference between night and day is getting smaller and smaller.\" Botanists believe that brilliant leaf colours associated with autumn are promoted by cold nights followed by warm, sunny days; in the absence of such conditions, the trees probably continue to produce the green pigment chlorophyll as if it were still summertime.

With the recent active hurricane seasons, a question one has to ponder is how would these tropical dynamos be affected if (notice I say if!!!) the temperature of the earth increases? Most people would assume that if the earth's temperature rises, that in turn leads to warmer tropical waters (again, that is open to debate as well!), which in turn leads to more numerous and more powerful hurricanes. The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), as well as other federal agencies and universities, will attempt to answer this question with the help of various computer models, according to this artice from Ft. Myers News Press. -If global warming is occurring, most scientists agree that there will be LESS numerous hurricanes, however, they will be more powerful. - There maybe fewer hurricanes because the disturbances that are needed to spawn them may be less numerous as global rainfall patterns may shift. -The more powerful hurricanes are due to warmer sea surface temperatures, the theory goes. Sea surface temperature, as well as the coriolis force, moist air, and low wind shear throughout the bottom half or so of the atmosphere, are key ingredients in forming and strengthening hurricanes. -This study hopes to help give government and other emergency agencies, as well as oil companies in the Gulf of Mexico, an idea how future hurricane seasons may unfold. Hopefully, this and other studies will help people who decide things such as how strong to build levees, how close to the ocean can a person build a house, and other questions at least an idea about how future hurricane seasons may be different than the ones we experience now.

Scientists aboard a Russian research ship along Russia's northern coastline have recently found an extensive area of intense methane release. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide. In an email from the ship written by Orjan Gustafsson of Stockholm University he notes the following......Courtesy of The Heat is Online article and the Guardian: \"Yesterday, for the first time, we documented a field where the release was so intense that the methane did not have time to dissolve into the seawater but was rising as methane bubbles to the sea surface. These 'methane chimneys' were documented on echo sounder and with seismic instrument.\" Gustafsson added: \"The conventional thought has been that the permafrost 'lid' on the sub-sea sediments on the Siberian shelf should cap and hold the massive reservoirs of shallow methane deposits in place. \"The growing evidence for release of methane in this inaccessible region may suggest that the permafrost lid is starting to get perforated and thus leaking methane.\" But, some climate experts urge caution with this news....... \"The problem is that in the Russian or in the Siberian Arctic on land and in the sea there is very little coverage by hard data and there are hardly any measurements. And therefore there is a lot of speculation going on,\" said Dr. Lorenz Schwark of the University of Cologne. \"As long as the scientists in the Siberian Arctic are not able to report very strong increases in submarine landslides and slope failures, I wouldn't expect that the release into the atmosphere is so severe that it is really very serious at the moment,\" Schwark added.

Keith is also Canada's Research Chair in Energy and Environment. Air capture is different than the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology which is a key part of the Alberta and federal governments? strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. CCS involves installing equipment at, for example, a coal-fired power plant to capture carbon dioxide produced during burning of the coal, and then pipelining this CO2 for permanent storage underground in a geological reservoir. Air capture, on the other hand, uses technology that can capture ? no matter where the capture system is located ? the CO2 that is present in ambient air everywhere, according to the University of Calgary press release. Keith and his team have shown that they can capture more CO2 than the energy needed to run the machine, which is very important. There are still some major issues with this project......... --Where would the captured CO2 be stored? One possibility would be Alberta's oil sands tar fields. --Potential high costs for the commercialization of this project.

Vicky Pope, the head of the Met Office Centre for climate change research says that drastic action needs to be taken within two years in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change. You can read her own letter to the Guardian right here . What is that drastic action? Cutting emissions by 3% a year from 2010 offers the only hope of avoiding a global temperature rise of more than two degrees celsius. Even if the cuts begin in 2010 (unlikely) and quickly reach 3% a year, the most likely forecast temperature rise would be two degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100, but even with that two degree rise the following would occur, according to the Met Office...... --One-fifth of species would be at risk for extinction. --Two billion people would suffer from rising sea levels and a shortage of fresh water. --The melting of the Greenland ice sheet would be irreversible, but it could take 3,000 years, according to Pope. Contrast that with a world where no action is taken to curb global warming. Then, temperatures could rise as high as 7C above pre-industrial values by the end of the century. This would lead to significant risks of severe and irreversible impacts, said Pope.

This, theoretically at least, leads to increased warming as the albedo is decreased and vast supplies of methane and carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere, thus in theory contributing to further warming, that causes further melting, that leads to more warming, etc. Basically, a positive feedback mechanism. However, this discovery by researcher Duane Froese of the University of Alberta's earth and atmospheric science department says not so fast, permafrost is more \"stubborn\" than first believed when exposed to warmer temperatures, thus slower to melt and release the stored carbon. In part, he bases this theory on his discovery of a \"cone-shaped wedge of ice\" near Dawson City in the Yukon of Canada that is dated to be 700,000 years old. This chunk of ice has survived warmer periods than what the earth is now. For example, the article states that 120, 000 years ago, the earth was several degrees warmer than it is now, yet this ice survived. -Does this bode well for permafrost? -Can it survive warmer temperatures? Mr. Froese says yes it can, especially the deeper layers, which are insulated from the warmth of the atmosphere. This discovery of that old ice, and thus Mr. Froese's theory, may put a dent in the run-away global warming thoughts due to carbon dioxide and methane being released when vast areas of permafrost melt. Maybe deep permafrost being \"stubborn\" is a way that \"mother earth\" regulates her temperature? One point that the researcher points out that this study deals with deep permafrost, while other studies have studied only the shallow layer of permafrost. This is why we hear about permafrost melting rapidly, as this is the shallow layer they are talking about. -Mr. Froese also mentions that deep layers of permafrost are a reservoir for much more carbon than the shallow top layers that are prone to melting. -In conclusion, the researcher says that this deep permafrost's ability to resist melting and thus not release vast amounts of carbon may cause global warming to occur at a slower pace than expected.

Michael J. Myers, an analytical chemist from Hilton Head Island who works in spectroscopy and atmospheric sensing, basically says that the man made increases in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is so small compared to the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere that mathematically the amount of increase is insignificant. Thus, carbon dioxide's increase in the atmosphere has almost nothing to do with the earth's warming (getting back to last week, IF the earth is even warming) A few thoughts about his article: -His idea is a valid point, since a modest increase in a greenhouse gas that by his numbers contributes only 3.6% to the greenhouse effect does not seem like a big deal. -Looking at his numbers on the internet, however, I have found a range of percentage contribution to the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide of between 9-26%, and the number for water vapor between 36-70%. Maybe someone can explain to me the discrepancy in the numbers, both in terms of the range I found and the difference between that range and his numbers? -Assuming the numbers I found are correct, and his incorrect, the calculations he performed would obviously be wrong. However, if you have to double, triple, or multiply by 6 (his number of carbon dioxide approx. 4% as compared to 26%) the percent increase in absorption of the sun's radiation by carbon dioxide is still very small. This is assuming too that his math and physics are correct. Anyways, this opinion piece may have raised more questions than answers for me.

Welcome to my second posting. Hopefully you enjoyed my first, and it is the first of many future blogs. Last week, I came across an article about global cooling due to a decrease in sunspot activity and thus a decrease in the output of energy from the sun. I chose this week's article because it talks about the same thing, but it has a different cause for the cooling. The reason in this article is that changes in huge ocean currents, such as El Nino/ La Nina, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation are absorbing the excess heat in the atmosphere due to the increase in greenhouse gases and forcing it deep in the ocean and causing cooler deep ocean water to the surface, thus cooling the atmosphere. This article from The Tyee made me think about two main ideas, and I would like to read your comments and thoughts about these subjects. First off, as mentioned by some of you in last week's comments, is there a way to get an accurate read of the temperature and thus temperature change of the earth? If we are not sure if how we measure temperature of the earth is accurate, how can we even debate whether or not climate change is occuring? With \"urban heat islands\" growing in size, are they influencing our weather stations, causing them to have a warm bias, and ruining our temperature data? Does moving weather stations, adding new ones, and removing some influence temperature data? Is satellite observation of temperature accurate and reliable? I think there can be a spirited debate on whether or not our current readings of the earth's temperature are an accurate representation of what is actually the earth's temperature and thus whether or not the temperature is changing. Secondly, let's assume that the earth's temperature is changing. What is causing this change? Our climate and atmospheric systems are so complex that would we be able to pick out one thing and say that this or that is causing climate change? Would we be able to say that the change is natural? Man-made? Let's assume that it is a natural cause behind climate change. Would we be able to point out one thing and say that this THE cause, or is there more than one natural cause, or it is a combination of man-made and natural causes? Or are changes dependent on one another, ie. does one change lead to another, and then another? Do these \"steps\" balance each other out, or do they contribute to one another and \"steamroll\" in one direction or another? My point here is that, assuming that we can figure out the first problem mentioned (ie. an accurate way to measure temperature and thus temperature change) would we be able to pinpoint what is causing climate change? And, if we get to this point, what can we do to stop it and fix the problem? No wonder why there is so much debate and so many feathers ruffled when climate change is talked about.

NASA recently dropped a total of 90 ducks (no joke) into the Jakobshavn Glacier, which is between Greenland and Canada.

The ducks, if found, will provide crucial information on how water moves through the ice and provide information about the movement of glaciers. There are still lingering questions on why glaciers speed up and head towards sea during the summer. On each duck it is written \"science experiment\", reward and an email address in different languages. So far nobody has contacted NASA about the now missing ducks. Maybe they should have increased the reward and written the amount on the duck. Just kidding! Greenland Glacers.

Increase in Antarctic Sea Ice is an Unusual Side-Effect of Global Warming 4/19/2010, 7:56:33 AM Sea ice surrounding Antarctica in 2005. Image courtesy of NASA. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey explain that the slight increase in Antarctic sea ice over the past 30 years is actually an unusual side-effect of global warming , not cooling. According to a NewScientist story from a couple weeks ago, wintertime sea-ice in the Antarctic has increased 0.6% per decade from 1979-2006. The reason for this may be shifts in winds, sea currents and snowfall. These same reasons have been used by some as an explanation for the widespread loss of sea ice in the Arctic basin. Here is a link to the Southern Hemispheric sea ice anomaly courtesy of The University of Illinois at Champaign going back to 1979. There is no trend line on this graph, but from eyeballing the graph it does look like a very slight upward trend since 1979. Over the past couple of months the Antarctic sea ice anomaly has come back to near normal. Below are exerpts directly taken from the September 12th NewScientist article ............... \"What's happening is not unexpected...Climate modellers predicted a long time ago that the Arctic would warm fastest and the Antarctic would be stable for a long time,\" says Ted Maksym, a sea ice specialist at the British Antarctic Survey. A key difference is that Arctic ice floats on an ocean and is warmed by shifting currents and winds from the south. By contrast, Antarctica is an isolated continent bigger than the US that creates its own deep freeze. Another theory was that warmer air absorbs more moisture and means more snow and rainfall, he says. That could mean more fresh water at the sea surface around Antarctica ? fresh water freezes at a higher temperature than salt water. Maksym predicted that global warming would eventually warm the southern oceans, and shrink the sea ice around Antarctica. \"A lot of the modellers are predicting the turning point to be right about this time,\" he says.

Brett. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ As a new meteorologist at AccuWeather I am not going to be pretend to be an expert at global warming, or maybe more appropriately named, climate change. This subject has interested me since grade school, and I even considered studying it at the graduate school level. I recently came across a research report written by Don J. Easterbrook, a Professor of Geology at Western Washington University that explains his theory of global cooling, which he says began in 2002, was interupted by the El-Nino of 2005, and will continue, by his projections until 2040. For the whole time period of 2002-2040, he expects a drop in temperature of about 0.5 C. Curiously, his projection is only for the Northern Hemisphere. This article stood out to me simply because since the late 80's, 1988 in particular, we have been bombarded with media stories warning of the dangers of global warming. Our more experienced readers may remember that in the 70's, there were many an article about global cooling and even an impending return to ice age conditions. So, an article on global cooling in this day and age, which may be seen as being more appropriate 30 years ago, piqued my interest. Also interesting is his explanation why he has the earth cooling. There have been recent studies and observations of a lack of (or at least not as may) sunspots. Professor Easterbrook says that the recent lack of sunspot activity may be part of a bigger trend of lower sunspot activity ( possibly similiar to what happened in the Maunder Minimum from about 1600-1700 AD where there was almost a complete lack of sunspots altogether), and lower sunspot activity signifies a slight reduction in the amount of energy being put out by the sun, and thus received by the earth. This was at leat part of the reason (if not the main reason) for the \"Little Ice Age\" that occured from about 1300-1800 AD. So the Professor basically says, if cooling happened back then from a decrease in the amount of the sun's energy hitting the earth, why couldn't it happen now? I personally think this is a possibility, the scientific reasoning looks sound, but I question where he gets his temperatures. The earth has been cooling since 2002, only briefly interrupted by El Nino in 2005? I'm not sure about that. How does he get his temperatures for his projection? I think his theory needs to be looked at, but his methods may need to be scrutinized more closely. Easterling also has a number of graphs in his report.

In an interview with stop Kingsnorth, which you can watch right here , courtesy of YouTube, Hansen says that there really is no such thing right now as \"clean\" coal technology since only a small fraction of carbon dioxide is captured. Hansen favors renewable and alternative energy and that trying to actually make coal technology \"clean\" would be too expensive anyway. In the interview, Hansen talks about how some of the poorest nations would be impacted by global warming due to sea level rise and a reduction of fresh water due to glacier melt. Speaking of sea level rise, Icecap posted a graph of sea level rise going back to 1993. In a letter from July of 2007, Hansen wrote the following from NewScientist......... As an example, let us say that ice sheet melting adds 1 centimetre to sea level for the decade 2005 to 2015, and that this doubles each decade until the West Antarctic ice sheet is largely depleted. This would yield a rise in sea level of more than 5 metres by 2095. Of course, I cannot prove that my choice of a 10-year doubling time is accurate but I'd bet $1000 to a doughnut that it provides a far better estimate of the ice sheet's contribution to sea level rise than a linear response. In my opinion, if the world warms by 2 °C to 3 °C, such massive sea level rise is inevitable, and a substantial fraction of the rise would occur within a century. Business-as-usual global warming would almost surely send the planet beyond a tipping point, guaranteeing a disastrous degree of sea level rise. --------------------- From what I can tell, based on the graph, I do not see any indication of his 10-year doubling time showing up yet.

In addition to another Arctic update, I think it is a good time to look at the Antarctic and the current global status of sea ice. Arctic sea ice The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) revealed last week that the month of August set a record for rate of ice loss. Arctic sea ice extent is still second lowest on record after 2007. According to the NSIDC, there is still another week left in the melt season, but it still looks like it will come up short of the record as the loss has almost leveled out.

Much of last winter and into the first half of this summer the Antarctic sea ice anomaly was close to 1 million sq/km above normal. Globally Finally, here is the latest Cryosphere today graph showing the status of the total global sea ice area. At this time, it appears that the sea ice globally is running close to 2 million sq/km below normal thanks to the situation in the Arctic.

I just saw this story from the Times Online, about a professor from the University of Edinburgh who proposes using a fleet of 1,500 unmanned cloud making ships in the oceans to reduce global warming. Say what? According to professor Steven Salter , the rotary-sail technology would be operated by computer. The ships would spray tiny droplets of seawater into existing clouds in order to enlarge and thereby whiten them, which will send more radiation back into space, cooling the lower atmosphere. Where would these ships be deployed? The best locations would be off of Nambia, California and the southern Ocean.

Image courtesy of NOAA. A West Virginia cave stalagmite has provided the most detailed geological record to date on climate cycles in eastern North America over the past 7,000 years, according to a ScienceDaily article . Gregory Springer, a geologist from Ohio University and his team examined the trace metal strontium in the stalagmite. The stalagmite was able to preserve climate conditions averaged over periods as brief as a few years. Through their study of the stalagmite, the team determined that there were 7 major drought periods during the Holocene era, which started about 10,000 years ago. \"This really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought,\" said Springer. Geologist Gerald Bond suggested that every 1,500 years, weak solar activity caused by fluctuations in the sun's magnetic fields cools the North Atlantic Ocean and creates more icebergs and ice rafting, or the movement of sediment to ocean floors. The data from this study is consistent with the Bond events, which showed the connection between weak solar activity and ice rafting, according to the researchers. Though modern records show that a cooling North Atlantic Ocean actually increases moisture and precipitation, the historic climate events were different, Springer said. In the past, the tropical regions of the Atlantic Ocean also grew colder, creating a drier climate and prompting the series of droughts, he explained. The climate record found in the stalagmite suggests that North America could face another major drought in the next 500 to 1,000 years, but according to Springer, global warming could offset the cycle. \"Global warming will leave things like this in the dust. The natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming,\" he said The findings of this study were posted in the Journal of Geophysical Research Letters.

A 6-year study of Arctic sea ice confirms that there has been a massive shrinking and drastic thinning of the ice. Highly accurate data, which was gathered on board a German icebreaker over several seasons has shown that sea ice in the Arctic has thinned up to 53% from 2001-2007, according to a University of Alberta study led by earth and atmospheric sciences Professor Christian Hass. Sea ice that was once 2.5 meters thick in 1991 is now 0.9 meters thick. Haas notes that the thinning is not only due to melt, but also to the replacement of older, thicker ice by relatively thin first-year ice. The regime change is due to faster ice motion, supported by the thinner ice. According to Haas, the observed thinning is a signal of climate change, but he notes it is still unclear what the underlying mechanisms are. \"The faster ice motion is due to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. The independent thinning is due to increased oceanic and atmospheric heat fluxes, and it is likely those atmospheric heat fluxes, like higher air temperature and increased infrared radiation, are the major causes.\" The previous three paragraphs were taken directly from the University of Alberta news story. By the way, earlier this spring, new data obtained by Hass indicated that there would not be a new record minimum ice coverage this year. I thank Steve Bloom for directing me to this article.

The article \" World heading towards cooler 2008\" talks about how temperatures the first half of this have run about 0.1 degrees Celsius cooler than any year this century. Why is that? Well, scientists from the UK Met office say that the main reason for this cooling is La Nina. If you do not know, La Nina is the cool phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is the unusual cooling of the sea surface water out in the equatorial Pacific. But for those who are rooting for an ice age, don't get too excited. La Nina has faded for now and the ENSO is fairly neutral, so global temperatures will be rising again, according to Met office scientists. Even though 2008 may indeed end up as the coolest year this century, the century is only eight years old and 2008 is predicted by the UK Met to be about the 10th warmest on record since 1850. The article also mentioned the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and how some scientists earlier this year predicted that the current phase would hold temperatures in check for the next decade followed by renewed warming as the oscillation reverses.

Researchers from the University of Bristol in England have determined that the only thing that can explain the transition from a mostly ice-free Greenland 3 million years ago to the thick, ice-covered land mass that we see today is a drop in atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide). According to the University of Bristol press release , 3 million years ago there was a notable increase in rock/debris on the ocean floor surrounding Greenland. The rocks could not have gotten there until icebergs started to form and transport them, which tells the scientists that the transition started around 3 million years ago. Using climate and ice-sheet modeling, the researchers showed that the dominant cause of the Greenland glacification was the fall from high atmospheric CO2 levels to levels closer to that of pre-industrial times. Today, atmospheric CO2 levels are approaching levels that existed while Greenland was mosly ice-free.

I blogged about that story on June 25th. As I expected, there was a fair amount of sharp criticism about his speech in the commentary section of this blog. In a recent post (pages 11-18) (Aug 4th) on his Columbia University website James Hansen discusses how he was bombarded with critical emails after that speech. I wonder if any of those came from some of our regular commentators? Anyway, Hansen explains that a majority of the critical emails insisted that the sun, not man, was the primary cause of climate change. In his response, Hansen explains why these ideas about sun and climate change are wrong and that speculation that we may have entered a solar driven long-term cooling trend must be dismissed as a pipedream as the solar signal in shorter term global temperature is too weak. See next paragraph. The text below is directly taken from Hansen's post: Solar irradiance seems to be slightly less at its current minimum than in earlier minima (Figure 6), but, at most, the decrease from the mean irradiance of recent decades is ~0.1% yielding a climate forcing of about -0.2 W/m2. The current rate of atmospheric CO2 increase is ~2 ppm/year, yielding an annual increase of climate forcing of about +0.03 W/m2 per year. Thus if the sun remains \"out\", i.e., stuck for a long period in the current solar minimum, it can offset only about 7 years of CO2 increase. The human-made greenhouse gas climate forcing is now relentlessly, monotonically, increasing at a rate that overwhelms variability of natural climate forcings. Hansen also tries to explain how science really works and admits that scientists may not fare very well against contrarians in you-tube style debates. Now you know why he may not be too keen about debating. Hansen includes a few of the critical emails within the sources section at the bottom of the last page.

Going back to 1878 data, storm numbers have supposedly increased at a rate of 3.8 per century, but the pre-World War II data has many inaccuracies, since the numbers were based on ship observations. In order to correct for these inaccuracies, Gabriel Vecchi and Thomas Knutson of NOAA tried to superimpose known storm tracks from 1965 to present over known ship tracks from 1878-1965. The duo determined that ships indeed missed many storms, especially during the early years (19th century) compared to the 1960's and that those early ships probably missed about 1/3 of the storms.

The current policy of wildfire management by supressing small fires is causing less carbon to be stored in trees, according to a new study from the University of California. The research team, led by Michael Goulden found that during the period from the 1930's to the 1990's mid-altitude conifer forests increased in area by 34%, but contrary to the conventional wisdom that more trees mean additional carbon storage- they found that the amount of stored carbon actually diminished by 26% during the same period, according to the Scientific American article. Current wildfire policy is to stop more ground blazes, which is preserving more and more small-sized trees which hold much less carbon compared to bigger, more mature trees. Potential Solution? Preserving the heftier trees is the easy solution to augmenting carbon storage and allowing them to play their ecological roles, says Nathan Stephenson, an ecologist from the U.S. Geological Survey. As the climate changes and puts stress on plant life, Stephenson says, it is probably better for the forest to get back to the way it used to look: thinner and less crowded. In fact, the national parks of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, with which he closely works, already use prescribed fire to thin forests. Burning or cutting down trees will release some carbon into the atmosphere. But at least, Stephenson notes, ?you reduce the chance that you?re going to lose all [the carbon] in a catastrophic wildfire.?

That latest updated graph below does seem to indicate that that the trend over the last two days might have begun to resume a more normal trend, but I think they will need another week of data to confirm that. The big question was why did we see this sudden drop off of ice coverage? According to the NSIDC, a series of strong storms helped trigger warm, southerly winds which broke up thin ice in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Looking at the sea level pressure map below for Aug 6th, 2008, you can see the large area of low pressure extending north from Siberia, the counter-clockwise flow around the low pressure produced the stronger southerly winds, especially over the Chukchi Sea. You can also see the large area of high pressure centered over Greenland. The clockwise flow around the high also produced southerly winds up through far northern Canada. By the way, that same pattern forced the chilly air that you normally see in northern Canada much farther to the south, resulting in the unusually cool and wet pattern that we have been seeing over eastern Canada, the Great Lakes and the Northeast U.S. Northwest Passage opening up again Just like last year, the famous Northwest Passage is opening up once again. Check out the August 10th satellite-microwave image of that region below.

Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, but there is much less of it in the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide. Anyway, in sort of a follow up to that subject, researchers in Australia have come up with a possible solution (at least in Australia) to this problem. Instead of eating beef, the researchers suggest that Australians should opt for kangaroo meat instead. According to the study, kangaroos, the national animal of Australia produce no methane through their flatulence since the bacteria in their stomachs makes their digestive process much more efficient. The scientists are also looking at ways to transfer the kangaroo bacteria to cattle and sheep. In the meantime, if \"farmed\" kangaroos can replace cows and sheep, farmers will save millions in feed costs and Australia could see a significant drop in greenhouse emissions. The country already produces 30 million farmed kangaroos in the outback. \"Fourteen percent of emissions from all sources in Australia is from enteric methane from cattle and sheep,\" said Athol Klieve, a senior research scientist with the Queensland state government. In New Zealand, that number could be as high as 50%. Anyone ever had kangaroo meat before? Here is the link to the article.

A new study from the University of Washington suggests that there is no clear evidence that human-induced global warming has caused a drop in 20th century snow levels and that the volcanic, mountain chain could enjoy a delay in the future effects of global warming, according to an article from the Seattle Times. Here is a link to the powerpoint presentation of the study. By the way, the first picture of the man skiing up to the roof of that building was the same hotel I stayed at during a visit several years ago on Mount Rainier. I am pretty sure that is the Paridise Hotel. When we went in July there was still many patches of snow up to a foot deep all around the grounds of the hotel. Cliff Mass, a University of Washington meteorologist and co-author of this study says that studying the snowpack trends depends greatly on which years are examined. Mass and colleagues tried to estimate snowpack before the 1950's, a decade where snow levels were unusually high and the reason why we see a greater than 30% drop off in snow pack over the second half of the century when you use that decade as the starting line. Mass and his team used a measurement that did exist before the 1950s: The amount of water that flowed down streams as snow melted. The team determined that the drop in snowpack from the 1930's through present time was 23%. (The 1930's in the U.S. was a warm decade, but I do not know if that was the case in the Cascades. It would be nice to know what the percentage drop was when you start out in the 1900's, 1910's or 1920's as well.) Mass and colleagues say that many of these changes in snowpack are attributable to shifting weather patterns driven by the Pacific Ocean, which is what we heard from the Mount Shasta glacier report I blogged about recently. The team also noted that computer models predict that the northeast Pacific will warm more slowly than most of the world's oceans, keeping the average rain/snow level from gaining altitude too quickly. Not so fast! Alan Hamlet, a University of Washington hydrologist, who co-authored a study on snowmelt hydrology in the mountainous West back in 2005 disagrees with Mass. Hamlet says the snowpack trends during the second half of the century are consistent with rising temperatures which are tied to global warming. He also criticizes some of the statistical analysis of the new study co-authored by Mass. You can read more about this story here. .

According to NASA, wind energy has the potential to provide 10 to 15 % of the world's future energy. The problem with wind farms is that they are unsightly to many people and they can kill birds. Installing the windmills can be costly at first, but once they are built the wind can be converted to electricity cheaply, assuming there is enough wind. Lately, attention has been focused on placing more wind farms over the ocean in order to minimize some of those problems and take better advantage of the wind due to less friction. The images below show the average wind intensity over the ocean from 2000-2007. The data was calculated by NASA scientists from the Jet Propulsion Lab using NASA's Quick Scatterometer ( QuikSCAT ). QuickSCAT measures wind speed and direction over the world's oceans. With this information, scientists will be better able to identify potential wind farm locations across the world. Wind speeds obviously change with the seasons. Notice the stronger winds in the mid-latitudes occur during the colder months as the jet stream strengthens and moves toward the lower latitudes.

Earlier concerns about the Arctic sea ice was that much of the Arctic Ocean this year was covered by unusually thin, first-year ice, which is far more likely to completely melt out during the summer 2008 melt season, compared to the thicker multi-year ice. According to the latest ICESat thickness estimates, it appears that the first-year sea ice in the Arctic Ocean so far this season is comparable in thickness to what it was in 2006 and 2007. Note the charts below. Why is that? The NSIDC says that sparse snow cover over the Arctic Ocean last winter resulted in less insulation from the bitterly cold air, resulting in faster, first-year ice growth. Snow was unable to accumulate last autumn since much of the Arctic Ocean was still ice-free, causing the snow to just melt into the open waters. Once the ice formed later in the fall, it accumulated more quickly than normal as there was very little barrier (snow) between the ice and the cold air just above the surface. Now, correct me if I am wrong, let's assume that there is even less sea ice coverage at the end of this year's melt season compared to the last two years, based on their above explanation wouldn't that mean that there would be even less early autumn snow accumulation compared to last year and thus another slight increase in the first-year sea ice thickness for 2009? Image courtesy of the NSIDC. You can also see that the multi-year ice this year is clearly much thinner than the past two years. The NSIDC notes that this could be due to two factors. melting at the underside of the ice that was observed in the summer of 2007 and the greater than normal export of thick ice out of the Arctic Ocean.

What a part of Antarctica might have looked like 70 million years ago. Courtesy National Science Foundation. The fossils were small crustaceans called ostracods, which dated back to 14 million years ago. According to the LiveScience report, ostracods could never survive in the the current Antarctic climate. In order for them to survive, it probably had to be about 30 degrees F. (17 C) warmer on average. These fossils are probably the last remnants of a warmer Antarctica, before the massive cool down set in. The scientists believe that this find will help them better understand the effects of global warming. This warmer period started to end when the first continent-sized ice sheets began appearing on Antarctica around 34 million years ago, around the end of the Eocene epoch. These ice sheets expanded and contracted until around 14 million years ago, during the Miocene epoch, when a dramatic cooling took place and transformed the tundra into an environment \"that today looks like Mars,\" co-author David Marchant told LiveScience.

Tad Pfeffer, an expert on Greenland?s ice sheets at the University of Colorado. \"Each new paper negates or repudiates something emphatically asserted in a previous paper,\" Dr. Pfeffer said. \"The public is obviously picking up on this not as an evolution of objective scientific understanding but as a proliferation of contradictory opinions.\" The flow of scientific findings from laboratory (or glacier) to journal to news report is fraught with \"reinforcing loops\" that can amplify small distortions, said Dr. Kimberly Thompson, an associate professor of risk analysis and decision science at Harvard. Dr. Thompson said climate science presented particularly tough challenges, given the long time lag before the worst effects kick in and the persistent uncertainty about the likelihood of worst-case outcomes. She said the news media sometimes overplayed the uncertainty by balancing opposing views in a story without characterizing the overall level of confidence in either side.

Most of the higher sea levels compared to the 1993-1995 mean were located in the western Pacific, western Atlantic and around Australia. The lower deviations were concentrated off of Scandinavia and the west coast of North America. The cool phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has been at least partly responsible for the warming of surface waters over the northwestern/western Pacific.

I am not saying that global warming is completely off the hook when it comes to some of these particular disasters, but there is just not nearly enough information (data) out there to link the two with certainty.

The technique would be applied to the sides of tall buildings as the window panes would make the buildings large energy plants. How does this actually work ? The light comes in and hits the dye which absorbs it and re-emits the light.

This technology was actually developed in the 70s, according to the BBC article, but was abandoned since the light lost much of its energy along the route to the cell.

Gore noted the following climate-change related issues in his speech......... 1. Some scientists say that there is a 75% chance within 5 years that the entire northern ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months. 2. Military intel. experts warn of hundreds of millions of climate refugees destabilizing nations around the world. 3. The recent strange weather and large number of lightning triggered fires across the country. That is still up for debate in my opinion. Too short a time period to draw any conclusions. Gore stresses that our over-reliance on carbon based fuels is the core of our economic, environmental and national security problems. Renewable Energy --Fuels that are not expensive don't cause pollution and are available right here at home. --According to scientists, enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100% of the entire world's energy needs for a full year. --Enough wind blows through the Midwest to meet 100% of the U.S. electricity demand. --Geothermal energy. Gore notes that there have been sharp cost reductions in solar, wind and geothermal energy production, while oil and coal have seen sharp increases. Exploding demand in China is the main reason for high gas prices, as it is overwhelming new oil and coal discoveries, said Gore. Tax what we burn, not what we earn. Gore supports a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in CO2 taxes. This is the most important policy change. Gore stresses that the technology is available to accomplish this challenge. Jobs will be gained at home and not lost abroad like they are now. Here is the link to his speech. I recommend reading his full speech before you comment on it. For the most part, I thought the speech was well done. It set some lofty goals no doubt, but I think that is the direction we need to move much more agressively toward in this rapidly growing world. What do you think? For more information and a video of the speech, you can check out the WE campaign at wecansolveit.org . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE Texas oil billionaire T.

As you can see by the image below, the highest annual carbon emissions pretty much, but not always correspond to higher population density. The graphic below shows the top carbon emitting counties. Houston, TX is located in Harris County, Texas by the way. Counties with the highest emissions are often, but not always, places with large populations. In some cases, a busy interstate highway through a mostly rural area or a power plant that supplies electricity to other counties (even other states) is enough to push a county up in the rankings, according to Kevin Gurney, an atmospheric scientist with the project. The graph below shows the average carbon emissions by month across the U.S. As you can see, we are probably close to the peak right now. The scientists are not quiite sure why it peaks in the summer, but I agree that it is probably due to a combination of increased travel and a high demand for electricity to cool homes and businesses.

First, check out the map below. The dark red colors indicate a sea height increase up to 8.9 inches during the 15-year period. The blue-green colored areas indicate where the sea height dropped. Some observations from the map (there are several others if you read the link)......... 1. The large-scale increase in sea-surface height across the western Pacific was mostly due to the presence of the warm-phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) during the period, which resulted in a large area of above-normal sea-surface temperatures that caused a thermal expansion of the water and a rise in sea height. By the way, the PDO recently switched back to the cool phase. 2. The very thin blue area (lowering sea height) off the U.S. East Coast could be due to a decadal change in the average latitude or velocity of the Gulf Stream current. The NASA article states that these ocean current changes over a SPAN of decades could be part of a natural cycle or indicate the beginning of a long-term change in a current as a result of human-induced climate change.

Notice the standing pools of water (snow melt) with an outside temp of 5.5 celsius (42 F). The same North Pole web cam 5 years ago to this day. The view is a little more zoomed in toward that upside-down L shaped pole in the distance. As many of you already know, there has been a lot of talk in the media lately about the possibility of an ice-free North Pole this summer. Andrea Thompson, a senior writer from LiveScience dug a little deeper and phone interviewed Mark Serreze of the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. Serreze was earlier quoted by a London paper that that in his opinion it was even-odds whether the North Pole melts out at the end of the melt season. In the interview with Thompson, Serreze cleared up some of the confusion caused by some media outlets...... 1. The potential melt-out at the North Pole would not mean that all Arctic Ice would melt, but that the thin, new ice around 90 degrees north could melt away for a few days. 2. This thin, first-year ice is more susceptible to melting this summer, compared to the thicker, older ice. A substantial amount of older ice melted last year. 3. Wind patterns and ocean currents over the last few months moved the newly formed ice over the North Pole, setting up this potential situation late this summer, but the North Pole is cooler than the lower Arctic latitudes, so it could resist melting. 4. Serreze is pretty certain that the region will lose a bunch of ice this summer, but the question of just exactly where that melt will occur is \"a roll of the dice\". One factor in determining these factors is the somewhat higher ice extent that re-froze this winter. 5. Serreze notes that a warm spring season has put melting about on par with where it was at this point last year. Check out this link to the current status of the sea-ice area in the Arctic Basin from the University of Illinois Polar Research group. So far it does appear that the current sea-ice area status is very close to what it was last year at this time. Also note, that the ice area in the Arctic Basin last year saw its greatest drop between the second week of July and third week of August. We may get some clues starting in the next few weeks. By the way, there are other scientists in this field that feel that this summer's melt will be less spectacular than last year's. No doubt, we will all find out the real answer in September!

Mr. John Casey, who is the director of the Space and Science Research center made this declaration at a press conference in Florida a week ago. The press release is basically an update of what was released about the theory back in January of 2008. I have never heard of the Space and Science Research Center until now, but according to their press release, the world's climate warming of the past decades has come to an end based on the 'Relational Cycle Theory' or RC theory. According to their website, Mr. Casey's original research on his RC theory was peer reviewed. There is a link to a more detailed research doc. report of this theory at the bottom of the research link. It is the first link and has graphs. In developing this theory, Mr. Casey studied sunspot cycles from 1610 to present. He determined that there exists a family of solar activity cycles that has a direct influence on the earth's climate and found that the cycles correlated strongly to all past major temperature lows. There was a 90-100 year cycle and a 206 year cycle. He estimates that the peak of the current 206-year cycle was between 1986-1987 with a peak range from 1962-2010. According to this theory............. --The earth will experience a significant temperature decline beginning between 3-14 years and lasting 2 or 3 solar cycles. --Global temperature reductions of at least 1 to 1.5 celsius. --The new climate will produce dangerously cold weather that will result in worldwide, agricultural, social and economic disruption.

Marc Morano, a spokesman for James Inhofe (R-OK), who is the ranking minority member of the Senate Environment Committee said the criticism by Boxer was unjustified.

Well, our friend Laura Hannon, who was the original moderator of this blog sent me the link to this interesting concept about a new way to generate electricity. Louis Michaud, a Canadian engineer, has found a way to generate energy from the tail of a man-made tornado engine by using the natural movement of warm and cold air currents. The key is to have a tight temperature gradient with the air at the surface much warmer than the air above. Michaud proposes using wind turbines placed at the bottom of the tornado could generate electricity from sucked-up air. He calls his \"tornado\" the Atmospheric Vortex Engine (AVE). Here is a link to his AVE site with diagrams and FAQ's. The AVE structure would be an arena 200 meters (656 feet) wide with 100 meter (328 feet) high walls. The source of the warm air would be from the exhaust of a power plant. With wind turbines at the inlets to the arena, Michaud calculates that as much as 200 megawatts of electricity (enough to power a small city) could be extracted without draining the vortex of its power. Michaud is currently working on a 4 megawatt prototype, but so far had no investors. He estimates that the 200 megawatt facility would cost 60 million to build.

Large amounts of lower atmospheric ozone, which acts as a greenhouse gas and not to be confused with the good stratospheric ozone, are being destroyed in the lower atmosphere over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, according to researchers from the UK's National Centre for Atmospheric Science and Universities of York and Leeds. The research team analyzed the first year of measurments from the new Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory . To confirm these initial measurements, the team flew research aircraft up into the atmosphere over the tropical Atlantic to make their own ozone measurements at different heights and their results mirrored the data from the observatory. What was the cause of this ozone loss? Instrumentation detected the presence of the chemicals bromine and iodine oxide over the ocean in the tropical Atlantic region, which are produced by sea spray and emissions from phytoplankton. The chemicals attack the ozone, breaking it down. As the ozone is destroyed, a chemical is produced that attacks and destroys methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Below is an exerpt from the ScienceDaily article about this story......... \"At the moment this is a good news story -- more ozone and methane being destroyed than we previously thought - but the tropical Atlantic cannot be taken for granted as a permanent 'sink' for ozone. The composition of the atmosphere is in fine balance here- it will only take a small increase in nitrogen oxides from fossil fuel combustion, carried here from Europe, West Africa or North America on the trade winds, to tip the balance from a sink to a source of ozone\", according to Professor Alastair Lewis, Director of Atmospheric Composition at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and a lead scientist in this study.

The image above at left shows simulated autumn temperature trends during periods of rapid sea-ice loss, which can last for 5 to 10 years. The accelerated warming signal (ranging from red to dark red) reaches nearly 1,000 miles inland. In contrast, the image at right shows the comparatively milder but still substantial warming rates associated with rising amounts of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and moderate sea-ice retreat that is expected during the 21st century.

The rapid loss of sea-ice will also lead to an acceleration of permafrost thaw, which will release additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It is believed that Arctic soils contain 30% or more of the world's carbon that is stored in soils. The NCAR team performed simulations using the NCAR-based community climate system model. From to the UCAR press release ........The team found that during episodes of rapid sea-ice loss, the rate of Arctic land warming is 3.5 times greater than the average 21st century warming rates predicted in global climate models. While this warming is largest over the ocean, the simulations suggest that it can penetrate as far as 900 miles inland. The simulations also indicate that the warming acceleration during such events is especially pronounced in autumn. The decade during which a rapid sea-ice loss event occurs could see autumn temperatures warm by as much as 9 degrees F (5 degrees C) along the Arctic coasts of Russia, Alaska, and Canada.

Scientists have devised a new type of CO2 scrubber that will capture one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air every day, but it will take two years to contruct the prototype, so don't get too excited yet! Also, as you may have already guessed, it is going to take an awful lot of these devices to have any type of measurable impact globally, so we are talking millions. Physicist Klaus Lackner from Columbia University, says that the CO2 could be removed from the atmosphere by absorbing it in various chemical filters and using a newly discovered property of absorbent plastic sheets, which would be used to clean those filters so they can be reused. The captured CO2 would then be pumped into greenhouses to enhance plant growth, according to the Telegraph article . \"I?d rather have a technology that allows us to use fossil fuels without destroying the planet, because people are going to use them anyway\", said Lackner. By the way, there are other types of scrubbers already available on the market. If you would like to purchase one for your backyard you can get it here . It will only cost $5457.67. Shipping not included. Oh, you also need to purchase an initial supply of CO2 absorbent material for $80.

Flannery say's climate change is happening so quickly that mankind may need to pump sulphur into the upper atmosphere in order to survive. His technique places sulphur gas into the earth's stratosphere to block out more of the sun's rays. How would this be done? Sulphur would be added to jet fuel and dispersed in the stratosphere. When should this happen? Flannery says we may need to be doing this in five years time. This process would also cause the sky to change color. But what color? Yellow? According to Flannery, the world was much more susceptible to greenhouse gas emissions that had been thought eight years ago. \"Regardless of what happened to emissions in the future, there was already far too much greenhouse gas in the atmosphere,\" he said. \"Cutting emissions was not enough. Mankind now has to take greenhouse gases out of the air,\" he added. In particular, carbon should be taken out of the air and converted into charcoal, then plowed into farmers' fields.

A new study by an international group of scientists in this month's edition of the journal Science has found that one-third of the nitrogen entering the world's oceans from the atmosphere is man-made. This is important, since nitrogen causes an increase in marine biological activity and carbon dioxide uptake, which in turn produces the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). This is the first time a study looked at these impacts on the open oceans instead of just the land. How does man influence this? --The use of fertilizers --The burning of fossil fuels in cars and power stations. Below are a couple of exerpts from the NASA Earth Observatory news release .......... The study found that increasing quantities of atmospheric anthropogenic fixed nitrogen entering the open ocean could account for around one third of the ocean's external (non-recycled) nitrogen supply and up to three per cent of the annual new marine biological production. While the increased biological activity has the beneficial effect of drawing down man-made CO2 from the atmosphere, the researchers found that around two-thirds of this is offset by the increase in harmful N20 emissions. According to the study, the effect of the increasing atmospheric nitorgen deposition are expected to continue to grow in the future.

To summarize........... Climate scientists Robert Allen and Steven Sherwood from Yale Universitry have used a new technique to show temperatures changes in the upper troposphere (7.5-10 miles up) since 1970 are clearly in sync with most of the climate change models in showing a general warming of 0.65 degrees celsius per decade. Over the past two decades, temperature data directly gathered by satellites and balloons had showed little or no increase in upper troposheric temperature during that period, but researchers suspected these discontinuities with the model projections were due to unknown changes in instrumentation and data processing. By tracking radiosondes attached to weather balloons, the team used trends in vertical wind shear to infer those of temperature. (Here is the link to Steven Sherwood's site on the project) According to the scientists, there are approx. 10X fewer discontinuities in wind records than in temperature records since the new prodcedure was able to eliminate systematic temperature biases in most regions, making vertical wind shear measurements (assuming I understand it correctly) a more reliable indicator of long-term trends.

Here is another collection of amazing pictures. The first image below shows the total aerosols (ash and sulfates combined) that were put into the atmosphere by the eruption. The second image below shows the part of the plume made up of just sulphur dioxide, which in some past eruptions, such as Pinatubo in 1991, ended up circling the globe and combined with water vapor to form a screen that shielded the earth's surface for more than a year. This ended up lowering the average global temperature by 0.5 degrees celsius. The second image, according to NASA shows that the Chaiten eruption put out relatively little sulphur dioxide, as most of the aerosols in the plume were ash. Based on this information, NASA scientists conclude that the Chaiten eruption is unlikely to have an effect on global temperatures.

Image courtesy of Wikipedia. A noted dip in observed global temperatures over 60 years ago, which puzzled climate scientists for decades may have finally been explained by a new study from the Colorado State University, published today in Nature. Between 1900 and 1945 ( see chart ) global temperatures (combination of land and sea) showed a gradual, but steady increase. Then late in 1945 there was a notable dip in the average temperature, followed by a very gradual warming trend through 1960. Scientists could explain some of the other sudden drops that happened during the century, but not the one from 1945. Scientists ruled out the usual suspects such as a volcanic eruption, El Nino and La Nina, according to the story posted on NewScientist. Dr. David Thompson , an atmospheric scientist from CSU, along with his collegues took a closer look at the 1945 drop and found that the 1945 land temperatures showed no dip, but the records taken at sea did. Before World War II, the United States and the UK split the duties of taking ocean water temperatures, but during the war, 80% of the observations at sea were taken by the U.S., while the British were only involved with 5% of the observations. Thompson and his team found that the two countries used two very different methods to measure sea water temperature. The UK dropped a bucket into the ocean and measured the temperature of the water in the bucket. The U.S. took the temperature of water that was drawn into the engine room. Canvas buckets used at the time offered poor insulation, and thus the bucket had a cold bias. The engine room method had a warm bias because the rooms were hot, and this should explain the warm temperature readings during the early 40s (World War II). Late in 1945, the British resumed their bucket duties at a much higher rate (50% of the global observations), while the U.S. responsibility dropped to 30%, which should explain the mystery drop.

I like his idea in the fourth paragraph. Here it is............... Dear _______ The nonsense that is the global warming debate can be likened to a Don King production, where the two main antagonists, well deserved ones at that, are still hours away from the main fight. Instead, we have under-cards that leave us simply wondering if we will ever get to the real deal. I use the fight game because in boxing in past days, guys went right at it. Jake La Motta and Sugar Ray Robinson once fought each other within a few weeks of a fight. There was no dancing and ducking and big mouthing, just the fight against the guys that deserved to be in the ring. This is exactly how this should be handled. Mr Obama, can the Al Gore as an advisor on the environment. Mr. McCain, quit succumbing to pressure because you want to look nice or moderate. Both of you, get the people that can give this debate its true merit in front of you. Hillary, if you are elected, the same thing (you got to admit, she is showing some Lady Thatcher or Golda Meir spunk these days). But stop with watching people that aren't the main event. Within the first 100 days of office, get the top five SCIENTISTS on both sides of the issue in front of you in the oval office and let them argue it out. No cameras, no press, just you, your closest advisors, and the people that are qualified to do this. Have trusted members of both sides of the aisles, but get the politics out of it. The polar bear situation should push Americans over the edge. The long term population has increased. In addition, the cold this winter may simply be a preview of what is coming. That we are basically going to make it illegal to get oil, from an area that can perhaps help us get off foreign oil, because of yet another problem that may not exist, should be enough to clear the air and reveal that there are alot of people supporting this position that are not driven by the science, but what may be an almost fanatical madness, and that should resonate with people. Sir or Mam, if you are absolutely convinced, after seeing people who don't think polar bears are as important as the people you are elected to serve, that argue out the science, then commit the American people on a path that will basically spend their hard-earned money on a problem our chief rivals are probably simply paying lip service too, then I will support you. But if you have doubt, after clearing away the feelings and looking at the facts, then by proceeding you will put yourself in a rush to judgement before the facts are clear that has left many Americans disillusioned about our nation in other matters. This is not a matter of politics, it is not a matter of feelings. It is a matter of science and facts and educated men squaring off and displaying their knowledge. A non-conclusive answer in this matter is no answer at all, and no mandate to perhaps send us on path that could affect the chance for the very people we should have the most compassion for, to improve their lot.

A new study, published in the Geophysical Research letters by scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the Ohio State University shows that computer analyses of global climate have consistently overstated the warming in Antarctica, according to the ScienceDaily article. The group found that observed Antarctica temperatures rose only by 0.4 F (0.2 C) over the past century, while the climate models simulated increases of 1.4 F (0.75 C). The computer models may have overestimated the amount of water vapor in the Antarctic atmosphere. \"This is showing us that, over the past century, most of Antarctica has not undergone the fairly dramatic warming that has affected the rest of the globe,\" according to NCAR scientist Andrew Monaghan, as they can now compare computer simulations with observations of actual climate trends in Antarctica over the past 50-100 years. The computer models are accurately simulating climate for the other six continents, according to the study. One reason why the continent has not warmed that much is due to the ozone hole over Antarctica, which is cooling the middle and upper atmosphere and altering wind patterns in a way which keeps relatively warm air from reaching the ground. Here is a neat movie of the ozone hole through March of 2008, courtesy of the British Antarctic Survey.

Well, scientists in Australia and New Zealand have developed a new type of grass that will cut the amount of methane cows burp up when chewing the cud. The new grass can also grow in hotter climates. This means that farmers should be able to maintain dairy herds? productivity and profitability in the face of a changing climate, while cutting down their gaseous burps and reducing their contribution to global warming, according to the Science Daily report . According to the IPCC, methane makes up 14.5% of humanity's contribution to global warming. Also, NOAA data, which I just recently blogged about, shows that atmospheric methane levels may be rising again after a 10-year period of stability. In the UK alone, methane from cattle could account for as much as 3% of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions. But......... This new grass, which is more digestible, could actually increase a cow's absolute methane emissions, since according to Alistair Macrae, a lecturer in farm animal health and production a diet too rich in highly digestible carbs can actually increase the amount of methane a cow belches out. However, productivity gains would actually mean less methane per unit of milk, says Ian Givens, an animal science professor. Observation.........

Most of what is out there the past couple of days is about John McCain and his stance on global warming, which we covered in the past and will do so again later this year as we get close to the general election. Anyway, I figure today is as good as any day to check out some of the latest global temperature anomalies. Here is the link to the latest Remote Sensing Systems MSU global temperature anomaly for the month of April. Note: You NEED to click the Anomaly button at the top to see the anomalies for April. I have not seen the GISS data yet. The biggest things that stick out on this map are..... 1. Strong positive (warm) anomalies over eastern Europe. 2. Strong negative (cold) anomalies over the northwestern U.S. and western Canada. 3. Strong negative anomaly over eastern Australia. 4. Strong positive anomaly over the northern/northwestern Pacific, which is one of the signatures of a switch to the cool phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Time to compare the latest global sea-surface temperature anomaly as of May 12th with the one from last year at around the same time in May. May 12th, 2008 1. Note the strong negative (cool) anomalies from south of Alaska down along the West Coast of the U.S. (Again, this is another signature of a cool phase PDO.) I suspect we may see cooler and wetter-than-normal conditions across the Pacific Northwest into the Fall if this holds. 2. Eastern Atlantic waters (Cape Verde Hurricane development area) are slightly warmer than normal, but the Caribbean is slightly cooler than normal. 3. Strong positive anomalies in the waters around northern Europe. 4. La Nina continues to slowly fade. Most of the negative anomalies are now out into the central equatorial Pacific, while the eastern equatorial Pacific,close to South America is close to normal now. 5. Much of the Indian Ocean is slightly cooler than normal. Below is May 13th, 2007...... 1. Note the narrow band of strong negative (cool) anomalies extending west from South America along the equator. 2. Most of the North Pacific was not to far from normal a year ago. 3. The Indian Ocean was close to normal.

There are also several large-scale global atmospheric circulation patterns which influence short-term climate across large regions on the planet, and one of those patterns in the North Atlantic Oscillation or NAO. The NAO is an upper level pressure anomaly pattern with one center over Greenland and the other center of opposite sign covering the central latitudes of the North Atlantic between 35 and 40 degrees north. The positive phase of the NAO occurs when there is below-normal upper-level atmospheric pressures (heights) over the high latitudes of the North Atlantic (around Greenland), while above-normal upper-level pressures are present over the central North Atlantic, eastern U.S. and western Europe. The negative phase of the NAO is the opposite pressure anomaly pattern of the positive phase. The positive NAO is generally responsible for the following conditions........ --Above-normal temperatures in the eastern U.S. and northern Europe. --Below-normal temperatures across Greenland, northeastern Canada, southern Europe and the Middle East. --Above-normal precipitation in northern Europe and Scandinavia during the winter. --Drier-than-normal conditions over south central Europe. The negative NAO is usually associated with........... --Colder than normal weather across the Midwestern U.S, Manitoba, Ontario, the Southeast U.S. and the interior Northeast. --Above- normal temperatures over Greenland and northeastern Canada. --Colder and drier conditions over a large part of Europe. --Above normal precipitation and snowfall over the Northeast U.S., especially New England and then up into the coastal Maritimes. The impact of the NAO on summertime weather is less pronounced and a little more variable. The strength of a particular NAO phase is another important factor to consider. A particular phase of the NAO can last for several months, and even a few years, but the length is highly variable. As of late, the NAO has been either neutral or slightly negative since mid-March. The latest ensemble forecast below predicts the NAO to remain negative through the third week of May before trending back to normal toward the end of the month.

A statistical analysis of natural systems by an international research team, which includes many members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has provided additional evidence that man-made climate change is altering the behavior of plants, animals, rivers and many other natural systems, according to the Nature.com article. The team studies the behavior of 829 physical phenomena and 28,000 biological species by looking at data sets going back to 1970. One of the researchers created a map (see page 10 of the pdf) of the world, which showed areas of warming and cooling from 1970 to 2004 and compared those areas by putting the thousands of data sets on the map to see if they were consistent with warming or not. Most of the observations came from the northern hemisphere, while Africa, Australia and Latin America were relatively poorly represented.

I saw some great shots yesterday, but these just blew me away. You can see the large ash cloud and the glow of the volcano, then you have all this lightning. This is not unusual during an eruption and we saw some of this with Mt. St. Helen in Washington back in 1980. The volcano began erupting on Friday with a 12-mile high plume. Many areas downwind, including parts of Argentina were covered with ash. Large volcanic eruptions can easily influence the world's climate (cooling) for a period of time, causing a decrease in solar energy reaching the earth, as the tiny particles of ash remain in the high atmosphere and reflect the sunlight. I talked with Jim, who is also well versed in geology and geography, and he also feels that this particular eruption will probably be too small in size to have a large scale impact on the climate. The far southern location might also argue against it as well. Keep in mind, this eruption is still very new and neither of us are experts when it comes to volcanic eruptions, so our quick opinions could easily be out to lunch. Jim Andrews also takes a close look at the volcano in his blog. By the way, I had another post all lined up for today, but this particular server was down all afternoon and I couldn't do a thing with this blog. The volcano story was a quick one to post.

These results are for 2007. In 2007, global atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by 0.6 % or 19 million tons. The global concentration is now at 385 parts per million. Pre-industrial levels hovered close to 280 parts per million until 1850. Methane concentrations actually rose for the first time since 1998 with a total of 1,800 parts per billion . Methane is 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but there is a lot less of it in the atmosphere as you can see. According to the report, methane's overall climate impact is half that of carbon dioxide. Why did methane concentrations suddenly rise?

That's the question researchers from NASA, NOAA and the Department of Energy are trying to find the answer to in recent weeks as they sample the haze from research planes flying over the Arctic. Using mass spectroscopy to identify what is in the haze, scientists are also trying to find out where it came from and how it interacts with clouds, sunlight and snow cover. Here are some of the things they found in the haze......... 1. Dust from the Asian Deserts. 2. Salts. 3. Particles from incomplete burning of organic material from forest fires. 4. All sorts of stuff associated with automobile exhaust and smokestack emissions. \"The Arctic is a melting pot for mid-latitude pollution,\" said Daniel Jacob, a Harvard scientist taking part in the research. \"We have signatures of just about everything you can imagine flying around in the Arctic.\" A.R. Ravishankara from NOAA suspects that some of these particles may absorb the sun's energy and give off their own radiant heat, like blacktop on a summer day. Below is an exerpt from the MSNBC article .............. \"How much of this aerosol is there?\" Ravishankara asked, summarizing some of things scientists hope to find out. \"Do they absorb light? Do they scatter light? Do they make clouds brighter or dimmer? Are they getting to the ice surface? Because if you add these absorbing particles to the ice surface, it could actually enhance the melting.\" If aerosols prove to be a major factor in warming, Ravishankara said, removing them could yield relatively fast benefits for the environment. ######## PLEASE NOTE ########### Due to an increase in spam into the comment section we recently \"turned up\" the spam filter from the host site.

The average annual carbon dioxide emissions per person, they found, was 20 metric tons, compared to a world average of 4 tons. The lowest anyone in the U.S. could reach was 8.5 tons for a homeless person eating in a soup kitchen and sleeping at a homeless shelter.

Overall, the percentage of coverage that was deemed to accurately represent the scientific consensus on climate change ranged from 67-83% during the study period from 2000-2006. Only 1.8% of tabloid coverage was written by specialist correspondents, according to the research team. Quality press has been generally accurate, according to the Oxford researchers, when it comes to the topic of climate change, but UK tabloids have a far wider readership with greater public influence. (note the readership tables in the study pdf. ) When interviewees were asked to comment on this divergence (between the quality press and tabloids), many pointed to constraints they faced as journalists and editors deriving from various politicaleconomic pressures, such as covering a broad range of news 'beats' with little specialist training and understanding, \"There is a really deliberately contrarian tone to threads, and though this is part of the irony and cynicism - to the extent that this influences the public understanding and perception it is detrimental,\" said co-author Max Boykoff.

Methane, a greenhouse gas that is 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide, has been coming out from the ice like small geysers, according to Sergei Zimov, a long-time Russian scientist who has been doing much of the research in the cold, inhospitable region of northern Russia. \"Sometimes a big explosion happens, because the gas comes out like a bomb,\" Zimov said. \"There are a million lakes like this in northern Siberia.\" The concern from Zimov and some U.S. scientists is that this thawing of the permafrost could accelerate global warming. Sergei Zimov's outdoor lab is a large area of tundra and larch forest along the East Siberian Sea. Many of his collegues in Russia are not concerned about global warming, but Zimov's lonely work (28 years worth) has certainly drawn the attention from the U.S. as some of his work has been published in American Science Journals. Today, millions of dollars in grants from the West and from the Russian Science Foundation have turned Zimov's station into a hive of science. Zimov also has been receiving funding for his work through the Soros Foundation-Russia. In Siberia, permafrost contains billions of tons of organic matter from the Ice Age. As the climate warms, permafrost on the banks of Siberian lakes collapses into the water, supplying bacteria with more organic material to consume and further raising the level of methane released into the air. This is a good example of positive feedback. Zimov believes that the melting can be slowed, but not stopped. He has reintroduced certain grasses and herbivores which dominated northern Siberian steppes over 10,000 years ago. Zimov believes that steppe terrain inhibits permafrost thaw because it retains less heat than forests and lakes.

Image courtesy of Wikipedia. Researchers have developed a much more accurate way of measuring U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels using a high resolution map which is 100 times more detail than what was available in the past. The new map and system is called ' Vulcan '. Earlier maps of greenhouse emissions were based on population areas of the U.S., while the new system is based on actual greenhouse gas emissions. The Vulcan model examines CO2 emissions at local levels on an hourly basis. To create the Vulcan maps, the research team developed a method to extract the CO2 information by transforming data on local air pollution, such as carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide emissions, which are tracked by the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Energy and other governmental agencies, according to the Earth Observatory press release . One thing the scientists found out was that the Southeastern U.S. was a much larger source of greenhouse emissions than earlier estimated, while emissions from the Northeast were overestimated. Exerpts from the press release............. James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, says Vulcan provides a \"check\" to judge the accuracy of existing satellite data. \"The high-resolution map from Vulcan also provides a picture of emission sources in a way that the public and policy-makers can understand, which may be helpful in discussing what we will do about the climate problem,\" Hansen says. \"Ten years ago there might have been resistance to the notion of examining who is responsible for the CO2 emissions in such a visually detailed way,\" Gurney says. \"However, what Vulcan makes utterly clear is that CO2 emissions cannot be exclusively affixed to SUV drivers, manufacturers or large power producers; everybody is responsible. We need to look for real solutions, and have a deeper discussion about energy use. It's not about politics. It's about doing good science and solving the problem, and we can all be a part of that.\" The three-year project, which was funded by NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy under the North American Carbon Program, involved researchers from Purdue University, Colorado State University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Photo courtesy of the White House. President Bush announced new goals for the reduction of greenhouse gases from the beautiful Rose Garden on Wednesday. The President proposed a halt in the growth of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2025, which basically means that emissions will be allowed to increase for almost the next two decades. After 2025 the emissions will decrease, as long as technology continues to advance. President Bush would commit to a binding international agreement on long-term reductions as long as countries such as China do the same, but this pretty much nothing new from what the White House has been saying in the past. Some of the key exerpts from the President's speech on Wednesday........ In 2002, I announced our first step: to reduce America's greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent through 2012. I'm pleased to say that we remain on track to meet this goal even as our economy has grown 17 percent. We will pursue an economy-wide strategy that builds on the solid foundation that we have in place. As part of this strategy, we worked with Congress to pass energy legislation that specifies a new fuel economy standard of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, and requires fuel producers to supply at least 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022. (This is old news) In 2009 alone, the government and the private sector plan to dedicate nearly a billion dollars to clean coal research and development. We must all recognize that in the long run, new technologies are the key to addressing climate change. But in the short run, they can be more expensive. And that is why I believe part of any solution means reforming today's complicated mix of incentives to make the commercialization and use of new, lower emission technologies more competitive.

A study from the Carnegie Institution has shown that the jet streams in both hemispheres have risen in altitude and have shifted slightly toward the poles over the 23-year period between 1979 and 2001. The shift in the jet streams could be due to global warming and fits the prediction of global warming models, according to the report . The researchers used data that included outputs of weather prediction models, conventional observations from weather balloon and surface intrumentation along with remote observations from satellites. Some of the specific findings from the study........ --The jet stream in the northern hemisphere has been shifting north at a rate of 12 miles per decade, which I agree is very small, but also pretty meaningless. The authors note that if the trend continues then it could cause some problems.....but when? --The northern hemisphere jet has also weakened. --As the jet stream moves toward the poles, tropical cyclones could become more frequent and stronger, since the influence of stronger winds aloft typically inhibit tropical development and create shear. One of the lead researchers of the project, Ken Caldeira, personally thinks this change in the jet streams is a result of global warming, but he cannot say for sure. He is very confident (he is willing to bet $$$$ folks!) that this trend (shift in jet streams) will continue. On a sad note ............ Edward Lorenz, an MIT professor and meteorologist who developed the chaos theory, died Wednesday at the age of 90. The Boston Globe wrote a nice piece yesterday on Dr. Lorenz and here is an exerpt from the obituary that some may want to consider when they proclaim that the tiny increase in atmospheric CO2 cannot possibly cause a major change the future behavior of the global climate system......... From the Globe, His work on the theory began a decade earlier. In the winter of 1961, Dr. Lorenz was trying to determine how accurate a computer could predict long-term weather patterns. He ran one simulation with a computer model, then wanted to extend the forecast, so he added a second simulation, with the same parameters and conditions of the first model. The weather pattern should have seamlessly flowed into the second simulation. Instead, the trajectories quickly diverged. The problem: a rounded decimal number. Dr. Lorenz realized that the computer stored numbers to an accuracy of six decimal places but, to save space, printed out results shortened to three decimal places. So, for example, 0.310625 became 0.311. For the second simulation, he had used the shortened figure. Even this minute discrepancy drastically altered the forecast. Tiny changes, in effect, could have catastrophic, and often unpredictable, consequences. And they made perfect predictions of weather, even through the emerging power of computers, impossible: Exact measurements of all the conditions could be upset by one small event, such as the flap of a gossamer wing.

Compare that to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) prediction of a rise of 18-59 centimeters (0.6-1.9 feet) by 2100. \"For the past 2,000 years, the sea level was very stable,\" Svetlana Jevrejeva, a physical oceanographer said, explaining that they rose just 2 cm in the 18th century, 6 cm in the 19th century and a greater 19 cm last century. \"It seems that rapid rise in the 20th century is from melting ice sheets,\" she adds. Why the big difference compared to the IPCC forecast? The research team from Poudman said the IPCC had NOT accounted for ice dynamics- the more rapid movement of ice sheets due to melt water (lubrication) which could greatly speed up their disappearance and boost sea levels. Steve Nerem from the University of Colorado says that there is now a lot of evidence out there that does indeed support an increase of about a meter by 2100, but that rise will not be uniform around the globe.

Kump, professor of geosciences. \"Biologically generated gases are dominant in the prehuman world. The abundance of these gases is correlated with the productivity of the oceans.\" The researchers found that changes in the production of cloud condensation nuclei, the tiny particles around which water condenses to form rain drops and cloud droplets, decreased earth's cloud cover and increased the sun's warming effect 6-10% during supergreenhouse events in which the mean annual temperatures in the tropics were above 100 degrees Fahrenheit and polar temperatures were in the 50-degree Fahrenheit range. \"The Cretaceous was biologically unproductive due to less upwelling in the ocean and thermal stress on land and in the sea,\" says Kump. \"That means fewer cloud condensation nuclei.\" How about CO2?

Here is Mike's post............. Recently, several articles have appeared in the popular press pertaining to \"black carbon\" or \"soot.\" In the context of melting glaciers, at least one of these articles stated that the soot warmed the atmosphere and contributed to global warming. This is a misstatement as to the actual effect of soot on frozen surfaces such as glaciers and polar ice caps. In order to understand the effect of soot, the concept of \"albedo\" has to be explained. The definition of albedo is \"The ratio of the outgoing solar radiation reflected by an object to the incoming solar radiation incident upon it.\" Fresh, pure white snow has an albedo of nearly 100% -- in other words, just about all of the solar energy striking the snow is reflected back into space. Since the heat is reflected rather than absorbed, the solar energy has relatively little melting effect. However, if the 'color' of the snow is darked by soot, the albedo drops dramatically. Since the soot absorbs some of the radiation that otherwise would have been reflected, heat transfers from the soot into the snow resulting in an accelerated rate of melting. It is important to state that this heat transfer can cause melting to increase even if the ambient temperature remains constant. I conducted a backyard demonstration on Christmas Eve 2007. Here is a photo of fresh snow cover in my backyard over which I had tossed some eight month-old fireplace ash under a totally blue sky Keeping in mind this demonstration is occurring just two days after the winter solstace (meaning the albedo effect is less than it would have been under clear skies in February or March), in just one hour, the greater melting in the ash-covered areas is already apparent: After four hours, the ash-free area has a depth of 5.5 inches At the same time, the ash-covered areas have a depth of about 2.5 inches. Multiple measurements were taken (note ruler hold about an inch in front of ruler) which yielded an average depth of 2.5 inches. The areas without soot melt about 0.5 inches of snow during this 4-hour period while the soot-covered areas melt 3.5 inches. For visual comparison purposes, note the ruler hole in the non-ash-covered snow above the shadow. Even tiny amounts of soot pollution can induce high amounts of melting. There is little or no ash at upper right.. Small amounts of ash in the lower and left areas of the photo cause significant melting at the two-hour mark in the demonstration. Any discussion pertaining to melting glaciers or icecaps must consider the accelerated melting caused by soot pollution in addition to any contribution from changing ambient temperatures.

The UK team found no evidence of a link between the ionizing cosmic rays and the production of low cloud cover. \"This is of vast significance because if the skeptics are right, it would mean we?re wasting our time trying to cut greenhouse gases. But we couldn?t find the link they were proposing which means we are right to be cutting carbon emissions,\" said particle physicist professor Terry Sloan of Lancaster University. The cosmic ray theory was developed by Danish scientist Dr. Henrik Svensmark. Dr. Svensmark suggested that when the solar wind is strong, the planet warms up because fewer clouds are produced and more of the sun's heat reaches the surface. Here is a DiscoverMagazine article from last summer about Svensmark and his research. Prof Sloan?s team investigated the link by looking for times and places on Earth which had documented weak or strong cosmic ray arrivals, and seeing if that affected the cloudiness ? but they found no significant link, according to the Lancaster University press release. Below is from the BBC news article ......... Dr. Svensmark was not convinced by their findings. Terry Sloan has simply failed to understand how cosmic rays work on clouds,\" he told BBC News. \"He predicts much bigger effects than we would do, as between the equator and the poles, and after solar eruptions; then, because he doesn't see those big effects, he says our story is wrong, when in fact we have plenty of evidence to support it.\" But Terry Sloan adds............ \"We tried to corroborate Svensmark's hypothesis, but we could not; as far as we can see, he has no reason to challenge the IPCC - the IPCC has got it right. \"So we had better carry on trying to cut carbon emissions,\" says Sloan.

In a follow up to my previous blog titled \"Researchers find no sun/climate change link\" I bring you a link to David Archibald's March presentation to the International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC), which is titled \"Solar Cycle 24: Implications for the United States\". In his presentation, Archibald tries to demonstrate that the sun does indeed drive the earth's climate, contrary to the UK study, led by Terry Sloan. Archibald uses the proposed relationship to predict the earth's climate to 2030. Some of the main conclusions from Archibald's presentation....... 1. The earth is getting colder (0.06 degrees per year since 1998) and will accelerate to 0.2 degrees per year starting sometime in 2009. 2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has a miniscule warming effect. 3. Increasing CO2 will increase agricultural productivity. 4. The ideal atmospheric CO2 level is a minimum of 1,000 ppm. Dr. James Hansen (head of NASA GISS) believes the maximum safe level for CO2 is 350 ppm. The presentation by David Archibald is right here. I recommend looking through it. It is long, but he does have some very interesting graphs. According to the ICCC, David Archibald is a scientist operating in the field of cancer research, climate science and oil exploration.

A new study published in the March 24th issue of the Journal Nature Geoscience says that black carbon, a type of aerosol, may be the second most important contributor to climate change after carbon dioxide (CO2) and a key to preventing warming in the short run, as reported by the article in LiveScience. Black carbon is produced in diesel exhaust and when wood and coal are burned. Dr. V. Ramanathan of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California and lead author of the study says that soot particles absorb and scatter the sun's radiation. Black carbon is the absorbing component of soot. Using data from satellites, aircraft and surface instruments they estimated that black carbon has a bigger warming effect than earlier though and much more so than what the IPCC estimated in their report. Dr. Ramanathan suggests that tackling black carbon emissions might be an effective way to prevent some short term climate warming, while figuring out ways to control rising CO2 emissions can still be sorted out. The researchers found a significant warming effect from black carbon at about 6,500 feet (2 kilometers) altitude, where black carbon absorbs not only sunlight, but the light reflected by clouds at lower altitudes. They say this effect is unaccounted for in model-based estimates used in most studies, meaning that black carbon's actual warming contribution has been underestimated. Its warming impact is more than some greenhouse gases, such as methane, Ramanathan contends in the article. Atmospheric scientist Dorothy Koch of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), who was not affiliated with the study, cautioned that the case wasn't that simple. Black carbon doesn't stay in the atmosphere for long, which means it might have a high effect in the short term, but greenhouse gases that stay in the atmosphere longer have a bigger long-term impact. There is also uncertainty as to just how much of the black carbon in the atmosphere comes from human activities, Koch said.

Dr. Phil Klotzbach and Dr. William Gray from the Colorado State University have just issued their updated long-range Atlantic Hurricane forecast for 2008 and the U.S. landfall strike probability. Once again, they are calling for a well above-average tropical season and a higher than normal probability of a major hurricane landfall in the United States. In section 5 of their pdf , Klotzbach and Gray discuss how the current conditions in the Atlantic basin are quite favorable for an active season. Where is the global warming part of all this? Well, in section 9 of the pdf, Klotzbach and Gray explain that the very large increase in major hurricanes in the Atlantic basin between 1995-2007 was in their opinion primarily a result of the multi-decadal increase in the Atlantic ocean thermohaline circulation (THC) due to changes in ocean salinity and not directly related to global temperature increase. Klotzbach and Gray feel that we should not read too much into the highly active hurricane seasons of 2004-2005. Even though the activity was unusual, it was within natural bounds of hurricane variation. The authors note that both 2006 and 2007 had slightly below-average and average activity, respectively. Klotzbach and Gray believe that the Atlantic basin is currently in an active hurricane cycle associated with a strong thermohaline circulation and an active phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). They expect this active cycle to continue for another decade or two, before we enter a quieter Atlantic major hurricane period. By the way, it looks like Dr. Gray is in the slow process of passing the entire responsibilities of producing these forecasts over to the younger Dr. Klotzbach.

Brett One of the Argo system floating robots. Several thousand aquatic robots that can dive 3000 feet down and measure ocean temperature have indicated that the oceans have not warmed up at all over the past 4 to 5 years. Even though some of the years since 2003 have been some of the warmest on record for the surface, its the oceans which really matter when it comes to global warming, says Josh Willis at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Up to 80-90% of global warming involves heating up ocean waters, which hold a lot more heat than what the atmopshere can. Since 2003, the robots have recorded no warming of the global oceans, but in fact, a very slight cooling. Willis feels that we may be in a period of less rapid warming. Sea level rises when the oceans get warm because warmer water expands. This accounts for about half of global sea level rise. So with the oceans not warming, you would expect to see less sea level rise. Instead, sea level has risen about half an inch in the past four years. That's a lot, according to the NPR article . Willis says some of this water is apparently coming from a recent increase in the melting rate of glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. Willis says we cannot account for all of the sea level rise over the past 3-4 years, but one possibility is that the sea has warmed and expanded, but that scientists has misinterpreted the robot data. So where is the extra heat going? Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, says that it is probably going back out to space, or it may have gone even deeper into the ocean. Obviously, there are still a lot of unanswered questions in regards to this topic. Stay tuned. Here is a link to the Argo homepage and the location of the robots across the oceans.

I am absolutely astounded that someone who refuses to publicly debate anyone on this matter and has no training in the field narrated a movie where frames of nuclear explosions were interspersed in a subliminal way in scenes of droughts and flood, among other major gaffes, can say these things and then have them accepted... by anyone. The list of degreed meteorologists, climatologists, scientists, that signed the Manhatten declaration stating their disagreement with Mssr. Gore's premises grows by the day. What gets me most is he goes on unchallenged one-on-one on this. Never in all my years of competition have I seen someone elevated to a level that he is, in any thing, without any face-to-face competition to establish credibility. When someone gets a PhD, his or her thesis is normally attacked, for lack of a better word, in something known as the \"orals,\" at least it was for those venturing into those waters at PSU. In other words, a group of people still in a higher academic standing than you, one you want to ascend to, will try to get you to defend what you do in a way where you show what you know, not by some programmed unchallenged remark, but by competition with the people that are criticizing. Why? Because you can defend what you know, if you have worked hard enough. It is typical of the mentality of this person, that he thinks that he should be able to get something for nothing, just go on unchecked, hurling insults at people who have forgotten more than he will ever know. You be the judge of this statement, and consider the source: Gore to 60 MINUTES: Doubting Global Warming Is Manmade Like Believing Earth Is Flat. In fact, here is an excerpt : \"...I think that those people are in such a tiny, tiny minority now with their point of view, they're almost like the ones who still believe that the moon landing was staged in a movie lot in Arizona and those who believe the world is flat,\" says Gore. \"That demeans them a little bit, but it's not that far off,\" he tells Stahl. I want to say that I have tried my best to be opened minded about this issue. But the more research I do, the more some of the claims of Bill Gray and John Coleman ring true. However, I am all for non-carbon based energy as a way of increasing the quality of life, and that has nothing to do with what I consider grossly overstated scare tactics. Let me direct you to a site to keep an eye on: http://www.francis.edu/ActionCenter.htm I have been told they are developing some kind of home-based energy generator powered by wind. The idea is you store the energy created by wind. Given I live in the Boulder, Colorado of the East, count me in. As it is, we are getting a house with a geothermal unit in it that cuts electric bills by up to 50%. So I don't need to hear I am some kind of nut that thinks the Earth is flat, especially from a man who refuses to stand up one-on-one with anyone that can confront him fact for fact. Last night I read an interesting story. GLobal warming is responsible for 770,000,000 people on Earth starving. Is that so? Never mind it could be a myriad of things, let's say that is right. The article also says that my 2085, that number may be 880,000,000. These people have to assume that we are plain stupid. Seriously. The Earth's population has increased four-fold in the last 100 years. Suppose we assume in the next 80 years we only double the population. Right now the percentage of people starving because of global warming (and I am being nice in giving them their figure, even though any objective person would question that) is about 13 percent of the world's population. In 2085, assuming 12,000,000,000 people, (it's liable to be more) if only 880,000,000 million are starving because of the climate, that means the percentage has dropped to less than 8 percent. So if we use that reasoning, global warming would have increased the chance of feeding a greater percentage of people. But you see what is done here. It's the same thing that is done across the board. Games played, and unless you look, you'll get taken. It is funny. Lenin said, in his statement that was meant to say the ends justify the means as far as building his utopian society, that one has to break a few eggs to make an omelet. We can argue if that is valid, for one would have to assume almost a messianic quality to the person to know they are right about the future. Is Mssr. Gore assuming that about this issue? But if one destroys the entire egg itself, one cannot make an omelet (I hard boil my eggs and only eat the whites, so maybe that is why all this is hard for me to understand). It's astounding, I am constantly reading and re-reading counter arguments to this idea. Let's remember, some of the major proponents with high powered doctorates that are on the other side, brilliant minds no doubt like Dr. Hansen and Dr. Mann, did not get their doctorate DEFENDING their global warming stance. It is not like there was a PhD dissertation with six PhDs, three pro and three con, challenging the assertions here. These come out of the natural curiousity and good will of these men, and I do not think they are anything less. However, you see the same thing with me in a way, when convinced of an idea on the future, because of hard work and research it's very tough to back away. There is a difference, though, of blowing the 3-inch line on a snowstorm, or that Omaha's winter was colder than I thought. We are talking issues that ORIGINATE WITH THE WEATHER, but have far reaching tentacles. Now, anyone that believes he knows absolutely what is going to happen with the climate in the future, well you be the judge as to who is the card carrying member of the flat Earth society, that person, or the skeptic.

According to the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), a large part of the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the Antarctic peninsula is now supported only by a thin strip of ice hanging between two islands. According to the BAS press release , it appears that the ice shelf is ready to to break out from the Antarctic Peninsula. Over the past week, satellite images of the ice shelf spotted a huge 25 x 1.5 mile berg (close to the size of Manhattan) that had recently broken away and was still moving. The BAS sent a Twin Otter aircraft out on recon to check the breakout....Here is a link to a portion of that video taken by Jim Elliot of the BAS. \"I've never seen anything like this before, it was awesome, said Elliot. We flew along the main crack and observed the sheer scale of movement from the breakage.

A BBC news report from last year ( Climate Sceptisim: The Top 10 ) gives counter arguments to popular skeptic beliefs. The statements that were countered: 1. Evidence that the earth's temperature is getting warmer is unclear. 2. If the average temperature was rising, it has now stopped. 3. The earth has been warmer in the recent past. 4. Computer models are not reliable. 5. The atmosphere is not behaving as models would predict. 6. Climate is mainly influenced by the sun. 7. A carbon dioxide rise has always come after a temperature increase, not before 8. Long-term data on hurricane and arctic ice is too poor to assess trends 9. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas; CO2 is relatively unimportant. 10. Problems such as HIV/Aids and poverty are more pressing than climate change.

An article in the environment section of Popular Science ( Popsci.com ) says just that ( Is Petroleum the Greenest Fuel We Have? ).

It's also believed that scrub is more effective at absorbing CO2 than crops. There may be a way around some of these problems, though.

NASA microwave data indicates that perennial sea ice currently covers less than 30% of the Arctic, compared to 50-60% in the recent past. Very old sea ice that remains in the Arctic for at least 6 years covered 20% of the Arctic area back in the mid to late 1980's, but this winter that figure is down to just 6%. The maps below shows the decrease in older sea ice by comparing the average February conditions from 1985-2000 with February of 2008. The image is courtesy of the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Walt Meier of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, says that this winter the ice cover is much thinner overall and thus in a more vulnerable state heading into the summer melt season. This month, satellite data showed the maximum sea ice extent slightly increased by 3.9 percent over that of the previous three years, but it is still below the long-term average by 2.2 percent. Increases in ice extent occurred in areas where surface temperatures were colder than the historical averages. At the same time, as a result of the export of ice from the Arctic, the area of perennial ice decreased to an all-time minimum, according to the NASA article.

Using a computer model to test how geological faults respond when buried beneath several hundred metres of ice, the team found that the vertical stress placed on the earth's crust by a heavy ice sheet can supress many types of fault from slipping. Unfortunately, with the faults pinned down for a long period of time, stresses in the crust grow, so if the ice does melt due to global warming they conclude that earthquakes will occur more strongly and more frequently.

I've followed Brett's blog fairly closely (I think he does a great job), but I haven't seen everything that he's posted lately, so I apologize if I post something that he's recently talked about. One thing that I find disturbing about the debate related to global warming (or climate change) is the unfortunate marriage of global warming and politics. In some sense, it's difficult to separate the two since political decisions are often made based on beliefs related to global warming, and the concept of a carbon tax (discussed recently) is one such example. In that case, a discussion of politics is directly related to a discussion of global warming. The part that I find disturbing is the fact that the global warming debate often becomes a political football, with the sides being largely divided along party lines. Democrats are supposed to believe certain things about global warming, and Republicans are supposed to believe other things. The result is that people, then, often use the discussion of global warming as an excuse to espouse their political views. This is intented to be a blog about the global warming debate, not of political debate. So as I moderate the comments, I will not post any comments that are only about politics, and it goes without saying that I, like Brett, will also not post any comments that include name calling or hateful rhetoric.

Now I'm scared! But don't worry, life will have already disappeared long before that 7.6 billion years as the earth will be a very hot, dry and uninhabitable ball in about a billion years, according to Dr. Robert Smith, Emeritus Reader of Astronomy.

That's no surprise to me since there is still not enough information out there to link specific weather disasters (floods/hurricanes etc..) with climate change.

Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) say they have found strong evidence of instabilities in the ice of West Antarctica. A group of glaciers covering an area the size of Texas have recently surged sharply in speed towards the ocean, according to the BBC News article. Satellite measurements show that three large glaciers have been speeding up for more than a decade. Specifically, the Pine Island Glacier is putting more ice into the sea than any other glacier in Antarctica. The 30 km wide and couple of kilometers thick ice sheet is now moving at a rate of 3.5 kilometers per year. The scientists are now trying to figure out how the glacier moved in the long-term past. The Pine Island Glacier is located in the top half of the area outlined in red on the map below, courtesy of the University of Hull. Julian Scott of the BAS said that the Pine Island Glacier was accelerating 1% per year during the 1990's, but last season that figure was up to 7%. What could be the reasons for this? The scientists think a lack of sea ice in that particular region is allowing a warmer, deep ocean current to undercut the glacier and lubricate its flow toward the sea. There is also evidence of a volcano that erupted through the ice about 2,000 years ago and the whole region could be volcanically active, releasing geothermal heat to melt the base of the ice and help its slide towards the sea, according to Scott. However, they do not feel that this is a result of the warming of the surrounding air. Icebergs calving on the edge of the Brunt Ice Shelf. David Vaughn of the BAS thinks a major collapse of this section of the West Antarctica ice sheet should be taken seriously. If the Pine Island Glacier continues to surge and discharge most of the ice into the sea it could raise the global sea level by 25 cm (10 inches) in decades or a century.

Specifically, the research team looked at public informedness of the risks of global warming and the public confidence in climate scientists. The goal of the study , posted in the Risk Analysis Journal, was to test the general assumption that the scientific assessment of the risks is both correct and objective, and that, by implication, the publics perceptions of the risks are both inaccurate and subjective. According to the survey, more informed respondents and those with high confidence in scientists both feel less personally responsible for global warming and also show less concern for global warming.

But why would people who trust scientists not be as concerned when they hear so many scientists warning of the perils of global warming? ?Though this effect differs from our expectations,? the researcher write, ?it is consistent with the notion that people trust that scientists will be able, somehow, to devise technical solutions to any problems that arise because of global warming and climate change.?

A group of climatologists say that greenhouse gas emissions will have to be eliminated completely in order to stabilize the earth's climate and prevent temperatures from rising. Current efforts/plans to just stabilize emissions will not be enough. Damon Matthews, from Concordia University in Canada, and Ken Caldeira, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, USA, used a global climate model to study how greenhouse emissions would need to change in order to stabilize global temperatures over the next few hundred years. Previous studies have only looked at what happens when emissions are stabilised, according to the report in NewScientist. So far industrial emissions total around 450 billion tonnes. \"Even if we eliminated carbon dioxide today we are still committed to a global temperature rise of around 0.8 degrees Celsius lasting at least 500 years,\" says Caldeira. Roger Pielke, a climate policy expert at the University of Colorado in Boulder, agrees with the findings. \"This research makes the case that simply stabilising concentrations is insufficient to stabilize temperatures. Their argument, if widely accepted, raises the bar on what it means to mitigate climate change,\" he says. The group says that current emissions targets for 2050 are not enough to avoid substantial future warming and that eliminating emissions or actively removing CO2 from the atmosphere is the only way to go. \"It is technologically challenging, but not impossible. The biggest challenge will be to get political consensus,\" says Caldeira. You see, it always finds a way back to politics.

In Steve's Feb. 15th blog , Anthony Watts shows us an example of how poor temperature data from a climate station has found its way into the NASA GISS temperature analysis. Watts takes us to Lampasas, Texas, which is a fairly rural community. The climate station was moved to a new location back in 2000. Looking at the new location, you can see many obvious problems that would have a large warming effect on the temperature. There is way too much asphalt surrounding the site, while there is also a large building with brick right behind the sensor, which would obviously radiate heat back toward the instrument. Check out the first graph shown on Climateaudit.org (blue one) and you can see the dramatic rise in annual temperature since 2000. Now I cannot prove it, but I would have to say at least half of that warming has got to be due to the change in location. Unfortunately in this particular case, the usual GISS homogeneity adjustment made no downward adjustment (post 2000) like it did for much of the 20th century, and actually left the plot as is, which just further enhances the warming trend after 2000. Now, I do not know how widespread this particular problem is across the country, and even the world, but surfacestations.org is doing a good job trying to find that answer in the U.S. I think the government will say that the problem is too isolated to have much impact on the overall temperature trends when you average it all out for the country and that there is just not enough money available in the budget to fix these sites, but obvious things like this need attention ASAP. What do you think? Just for fun, here is the GISS temperature plot for Llano, Texas, a similar rural area just 36 miles away from Lampasas. It does indeed show a rise in temperature post 2000, but nothing out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, I could not find a picture of the observing site.

The closed cycle - meaning equal amounts of carbon dioxide emitted and removed from the air would mean that cars, trucks and airplanes using the synthetic fuels would no longer contribute to global warming, according to the New York Times article. I know, you're saying that there must be a catch, well sort of........no prototype has yet to be built, but the scientists say it is all based on existing technology. One major caveat to building a (CO2 to gasoline) factory is that it would require a great deal of energy. A nuclear power plant and the development of a new electrochemical process might be able to overcome that obstacle. The Los Alamos proposal does not violate any laws of physics, and other scientists, like George A. Olah, a Nobel Prize-winning chemist at the University of Southern California, and Klaus Lackner, a professor of geophysics at Columbia University, have independently suggested similar ideas. Dr. Martin said he and Dr. Kubic had worked out their concept in more detail than previous proposals. What would be the cost of the project? About 5 billion. The concept would be able to produce gasoline at a cost of $1.40 per gallon and it would be made economically viable at a cost of $4.60 to the consumer. Technology advances might be able to get that cost down to $3.40.

Here is the latest world sea-surface anomaly image (Feb 18th, 2008). Note: the colder anomalies have moved westward away from South America. There are now some subtle hints that the La Nina conditions (colder than normal sea surface water temperatures) across the equatorial Pacific may have peaked in intensity. The latest oceanic index value from NOAA for the (NOV/DEC/JAN) time period was a -1.4. A number less than -0.5 for a three consecutive running mean is characterized as a La Nina, while a number above 0.5 is considered an El Nino. Sea surface water temperatures across the central and western equatorial Pacific are still solidly below normal, but positive anomalies have recently begun to show up in the eastern (1+2 nino) region near the west coast of South America, and this \"may\" already be having some impact on the overall weather pattern across North America. The latest IRI experimental ensemble SST forecast for the Nino 3 region, which covers the eastern half of the equatorial Pacific, is forecasting sea surface temperature anomalies to be back to normal by early summer, if not slightly above. This is certainly an upward trend compared to what it was forecasting back in January. Now, as I have said in the past, the track record of these forecasts is nothing great, and this particular one is experimental, but I think it is on to something as it is common to see these La Nina's peak out by late in the winter.

Indeed, major publications such as Newsweek, Time, the New York Times and National Geographic published articles in the 1970's about the possibility of a new ice age, but Thomas Peterson of the National Climatic Data Center surveyed dozens of peer-reviewed scientific articles from 1965-1979 and found the following....... 7 supported global cooling. 44 predicted warming. 20 were neutral in regards to future climate trends. Excerpts from the USAtoday article........... The study concludes, \"There was no scientific consensus in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an imminent ice age. \"A review of the literature suggests that, to the contrary, greenhouse warming even then dominated scientists' thinking about the most important forces shaping Earth's climate on human time scales.\" \"I was surprised that global warming was so dominant in the peer-reviewed literature of the time,\" says Peterson, who was also a contributor to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007 report.

Climate change was not the only thing responsible for the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctica Peninsula six years ago, but it was only only one of a number of contributory factors, according to a new study just published in the Journal of Glaciology by Dr. Neil Glasser of Aberystwyth University and Ted Scambos from Colorado University. The study, as reported by the BBC article says that the ice shelf was on the brink of collapse for decades and that a combination of atmospheric, oceanic and glaciological factors contributed to its demise. Melting from higher ocean temperatures or a gradual decline in the ice mass of the peninsula over the centuries pushed the Larsen B shelf to the brink, according to Dr. Scambos. In their conclusion, the author's mentioned the following main reasons for the collapse.... 1. Structural glaciological discontinuities played a large part because they rendered the ice shelf mechanically weak. 2. Failures along weakly sutured flow-unit boundaries. 3. Loss of ice at the shelf front, which is the strongest part of the shelf. 4. Perturbations of input velocity from tributary glacier flows caused the sutures to rupture and cause the ice shelf to collapse rapidly.

The one I attended was held at Penn State University. There were several experts who spoke about climate change throughout the day and it was quite interesting. At least three of the speakers on the Penn State panel had a role in the writing of a particular chapter of the IPCC report. One of those authors stated that he was initially a strong skeptic, but after 15 years of researching climate change he is no longer a skeptic. One of the speakers at the event was Dr. Brent Yarnal, a professor of Geography at Penn State and the director of the Center for Integrated Regional Assessment (CIRA). Dr. Yarnal helped author the Middle Atlantic Regional Assessment (MARA) of Impacts from Climate Change. Granted, this is just one region in the U.S. and one small piece of the planet, but I thought some of the assessment was interesting. The assessment includes the region from central New York state to northeastern North Carolina. The assessment considers two climate change scenarios, one from the Hadley Centre in the UK and the other from the Canadian Climate Center (CCC). Based on these two scenarios the authors of the MARA team came up with the following for the impact of climate change on the Middle Atlantic region........ --A much more variable climate (More extreme storms, floods, but also more drought) --Agriculture across the region would be able to adapt, but uncertainties about weeds, pests and disease could alter that assessment Forests --Forests across the region would continue to migrate.

Three areas that are at the top of the list are the Arctic sea ice, the Greenland ice sheet and the dieback of the Amazon rainforests. Also mentioned were the boreal forests, El Nino, the western Antarctica Ice Sheet and the African and Indian monsoons. The study appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Although the scientists cannot be sure precisely when each region will reach the point of no return, their assessment warns it may already be too late to save Arctic sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet, which they regard as the most immediately in peril. By some estimates, there will not be any sea ice in the summer months within 25 years, according to the Guardian Unlimited article . \"There's a perception that global warming is something that will happen smoothly into the future, but some of these ecosystems go into an abrupt decline when warming reaches a certain threshold,\" said Tim Lenton, an environmental scientist at the University of East Anglia and lead author of the study. \"If we know when the different tipping points are, we can use them to inform targets to limit global warming. It gives us something to aim for,\" he added. Dr. Klaus Keller, an assistant professor of Geosciences at Penn State spoke about climate thresholds at the \"Focus the Nation\" teach-in that I attended at Penn State last Thursday. Dr. Keller is also a contributing author to the fourth assessment of the IPCC report. Dr. Keller co-authored the chapter titled \"Assessing Key Vulnerabilities and The Risk from Climate Change\". In Dr. Keller's short presentation he talked about examples of potent climate threshold such as... --The Greenland Ice sheet melting (as mentioned in the article) --Coral bleaching --El Nino --The possible shutdown of the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation ( MOC ) which is a critical ocean circulation that transfers heat from the lower latitudes to the higher latitudes and has a large impact on the climate of the earth. But, according to Dr. Keller, the IPCC says that it is unlikely (1-10% chance) that the MOC will undergo a large abrubt transition in the 21st century.

The January 24th image shows solidly frozen fast ice. ( Fast ice is ice that is anchored to the shoreline.) Nearly a week later you can see a distinct blue area, which indicates areas where the snow has melted, revealing a layer of sea ice below. There might also be a thin film of water on the blue ice surface, according to the NASA news release . This process is typical during the Antarctic summer months and not a sign of global warming. Actually, the summer thaw down there was later than normal, and NASA believes that La Nina might have something to do with that. Usually, the breakup of fast ice around the Antarctica Peninsula occurs in early to mid-December, but this area was solidly frozen well into January.

Biofuels were originally touted as better than fossil fuels because the carbon released when they were burned was balanced by the carbon absorbed when plants grew. Production of almost all biofuels either directly or indirectly resulted in new lands being cleared either for food or fuel, and that has led to the destructions of large ecosystems such as tropical rainforests and South American grasslands which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere when they are either burned or plowed. This process in return makes the land less capable of absorbing carbon emissions. From the New York Times article .........\"When you take this into account, most of the biofuel that people are using or planning to use would probably increase greenhouse gasses substantially,\" said Timothy Searchinger, lead author of one of the studies and a researcher in environment and economics at Princeton University. \"Previously there?s been an accounting error: land use change has been left out of prior analysis.\" The clearance of grassland releases 93 times the amount of greenhouse gas that would be saved by the fuel made annually on that land, said Joseph Fargione, lead author of the second paper, and a scientist at the Nature Conservancy. ?So for the next 93 years you?re making climate change worse, just at the time when we need to be bringing down carbon emissions.?

The team found important details about the Greenland Ice sheet which have long been missing from the ice sheet models in which sea level rise and global warming are based. The use of remote sensing and digital imaging techniques can produce rich datasets without field data and give ice sheet modelers more precise, detailed data, according to the ScienceDaily story . Traditional ice sheet models are very simplified, according to Dr. Beata Csatho, assistant professor of Geology at UB and the lead author of the study. \"Ice sheet models usually don't include all the complexity of ice dynamics that can happen in nature.

The Jakobshavn Isbrae glacier has experienced rapid thinning and has doubled the amount of ice it discharges into Disko Bay during the past decade. The thinning started as early as the end of the 18th century, but the changes that the researchers are seeing are now bigger than can be accounted for by normal, annual perturbations in climate, according to Dr. Csatho.

In this blog I am not going to get into how those predictions were made, that's another post, but rather the tools that are currently used to measure fluctuations in ocean levels. The BBC News had a nice article from Tuesday which touched on the subject. One project that has been in operation since 1994 is the South Pacific Sea Level and Climate Monitoring Project ( SPSLCMP ). The project involves the use of 12 sea-level fine resolution acoustic measuring equipment (seaframe) monitoring stations scattered among small south Pacific island nations. The stations are fitted with continuous global positioning system (CGPS) technology, which can measure whether the elevation of the equipment is sinking or rising up out of the water. Another tool which can give a real-time global view of the world's oceans is the radar altimeter on a satellite. The satellite radar altimeter can detect ocean levels to the millimeter. It gets even better, Jason-2 , set to launch in June 2008 is a low-orbit satellite fitted with the latest generation altimeter, called Poseidon-3. This altimeter will be able to map 95% of the ice-free oceans' topography every 10 days, monitor ocean circulation, climate change and of course, the slightest change in sea levels.

They are a major group of Eukaryotic Algae, which is a common type of phytoplankton. Scientists are currently trying to figure out how much of the diatom's ability to take out the atmospheric CO2 will be affected by global climate change. Diatoms, most of which are far too tiny to see without magnification, are incredibly important in the global carbon cycle, says Thomas Mock, a University of Washington postdoctoral researcher in oceanography and lead author of the paper. During photosynthesis, diatoms turn carbon dioxide into organic carbon and, in the process, generate oxygen. They are responsible for 40 percent of the organic carbon produced in the world's oceans each year, according to the ScienceDaily article Diatoms are encased with a cell wall (shell) made of silica, called a frustle. When they die in the oceans, the heavier weight of the shell causes them to sink, taking the carbon out of the surface waters and to the ocean floor. During their research, scientists discovered that under low-iron conditions, the diatoms grew more slowly and individual diatoms tended to clump together, making them even heavier and more likely to sink. Many studies, some of which we have previously discussed here, have suggested iron fertilization of the oceans to offset global warming, since diatoms become more numerous and thus absorb more CO2, but based on the results of this current research, more iron could mean the shells will be less likely to sink, and would remain in the upper ocean where the carbon they contain might be released back into the atmosphere when they die. \"Iron increases primary production by diatoms but our study adds another concern about the efficiency of iron fertilization,\" Mock says. Scientists are also looking into manipulating the diatome genes responsible for the silica production in the shells in order to produce even smaller lines of computer chips.

A 2002 study by U.S. researchers had concluded that the temperature spread between day and night over the lower 48 states increased by 1.5C over long-term averages between Sept. 11 and 14 in 2001, when commercial air flights were mostly grounded over North America. Canadian flights were completely grounded for 48 hours following the attacks. Professor William Van Wijngaarden looked at Canadian temperature records for the contrail-free days immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001 and was unable to find any significant changes in the diurnal temperature range (span between daytime highs and nighttime lows) which ended up falling well within the long-term average from 1977 to 2005. The York University researcher said he decided to double-check the U.S. findings because the claimed temperature rise was so large, almost equal to the global average temperature increase from greenhouse warming, according to the Star. But when he examined the spread between day and night temperatures from 112 weather stations across Canada for Sept. 8 to 17 in 2001, there wasn't a spike during the no-fly period. The lead researcher on the original U.S. study told the Star that the negative results from Canada don't necessarily undermine his group's findings. \"It's possible that Canada simply doesn't have a high enough density of jet traffic for contrails to make any difference,\" said David Travis, a geography professor at the University of Wisconsin in Whitewater.

A new NOAA study based on observations, instead of computer models, has found that warming global sea-surface temperatures is associated with a sustained, long-term increase in vertical wind shear in the main development region for Atlantic hurricanes, which may be reducing the number of hurricanes that landfall in the U.S.. In general, vertical wind shear hinders the development of tropical cyclones by removing thunderstorms from the center of circulation and disrupting the overall circulation of the storm in the mid and upper levels of the atmosphere. \"Using data extending back to the middle nineteenth century, we found a gentle decrease in the trend of U.S. landfalling hurricanes when the global ocean is warmed up. This trend coincides with an increase in vertical wind shear over the tropical North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, which could result in fewer U.S. landfalling hurricanes,\" said Chunzai Wang, a physical oceanographer with NOAA. Observations from 1854-2006 show a warming of sea-surface temperature occurring almost everywhere over the global ocean, according to the study. Where the global warming occurs is important for determining the vertical wind shear in the Atlantic huricane main development region between 10 and 20 degrees north latitude from west Africa to Central America. Warmer waters in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans increased vertical wind shear in the Atlantic hurricane main development region, while warming in the North Atlantic decreased vertical wind shear. Overall, the warming of the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans had a much greater impact than the North Atlantic. What do you make of this study? You can't blame the computer models on this one.

Now, we have new research from University College London and published in the Journal Nature which shows that just a 0.5 degree celsius (0.9 F) rise in the Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperature can fuel a 40% increase in Atlantic basin hurricane activity compared to the 50-year average (1950-2000). The study shows that the warming is directly linked to frequency, strength and duration of hurricanes. The interaction of greenhouse gases on ocean water temperatures was not considered in this study, according to the Guardian Unlimited article . Adam Lea and Mark Sanders, the scientists who co-led the study built a statistical model (yes, we are back to models again) based on local sea-surface temperature and wind to replicate hurricane activity over the past 40 years. This statistical model then allowed the researchers to remove the effects of wind to determine the sole impact of sea-surface warming on Atlantic basin hurricanes.

The research teams suspect that rainwater dripping into caves to grow stalagmites during dry years would seep in slowly enough to have time to pick up trace metals and natural isotopes from the soil. During wet years, the water would move through too fast to leach out the elements. If their theory is correct, the varying levels of isotopic and trace metal concentrations in stalagmites should indicate droughts and deluges in Australia going as far back as 500,000 years ago! In order for this work, the scientists needed to find a way to accurately age the cave formations. The solution came by finding minute traces of radioactive fallout from the bomb tests of the 1950's and 1960's within the stalagmites. Dr Ed Hodge, a carbon-dating specialist, said the scientists' research showed stalagmites could be used to reveal past weather patterns. \"One stalagmite in Western Australia, known to be 81 years old, showed a 20 per cent decrease in annual precipitation since 1965,\" closely matching official weather records. The scientists are now confident they can date stalagmites up to 500,000 years old by dating not man-made fallout but their ratios of natural uranium and thorium. This information can then also be used to help scientists understand climate changes over the same period of time. I would assume that similar information could be gathered throughout the many limestone caves across the world, not just Australia.

The research project, led by Dr. Eric Rignot of the Radar Science and Engineering section at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab found that the ice mass loss increased by 75% over the 10 year period. There was a net loss of 196 billion tonnes of ice in 2006 compared to 112 billion tonnes in 1996. The ice loss in 2006 raised sea levels about a 1/2 millimeter. The biggest losses were in West Antarctica and along the Antarctic Peninsula, while East Antarctica was fairly stable and has seen a slight increase in mass. According to the GlobeandMail.com article, the figures were calculated by deducting the amount of ice losses on the continent from the amount of snow computer models indicate it receives.The figures were based on satellite data on ice thickness and the speeds at which glaciers are flowing into the ocean. Dr. Rignot said the shrinkage can be attributed to upwelling of warm waters along the Antarctic coast, which is causing some glaciers to flow more rapidly into the ocean. He suspects the trend is due to global warming and not a normal natural fluctuation. Some experts have even speculated that global warming might lead to increases in ice accumulation in Antarctic's interior due to more snowfall. However, many experts say that this effect is unlikely to offset Antarctica's contribution to sea level rise because of the rapid melting of coastal glaciers, as the article explains. \"The concept that global warming will increase precipitation in Antarctica and mitigate sea level rise is a lullaby,\" Dr. Rignot said. The main driver for mass balance is the rate of glacier flow to the sea, not the precipitation rate, since other recent studies showed that there has not been a significant change in the actual precipitation rate.

Seven years is not very much when you are looking at climate, but it is interesting when when you compare everything on a graph , which is displayed in Tierney's column.

A climate scientist suggested comparing what has happened since 2000 with the predictions made by the IPCC. There are many different versions of what has happened with the global temperatures over the past 7 years, as many of our readers are well aware of. There are different groups doing the measuring and some of the measurements are based on satellite data, while others are based on surface data. Thanks to Pielke, you can compare the IPCC forecast with the actual temperature records of the four different measurements. You can see that the GISS temperature (courtesy of NASA and Dr. James Hansen) is the only one that is still recently within the IPCC range of uncertainty forecast, while the other three have fallen below the IPCC range . Over the past two years, the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) data has trended the farthest away (cooler) from the IPCC forecast. Pielke Jr. goes further with a recent post on his Prometheus site, and he shows you the same graph going back to 1990.

Globally --The combined land/ocean surface annual temperature is expected to be near 58 F, which would make 2007 the 5th warmest since records began in 1880. --Assuming the above is correct, this will make 7 of the 8 warmest years on record to have occurred since 2001 and the ten warmest will have all occurred since 1997. --The rate of warming since 1976 has been about 3 times faster than the century-scale trend. --The largest warm anomalies were from eastern Europe to central Asia. --The greatest warming during 2007 was in the northern latitudes of the northern hemisphere. --2007 continued the trend of end-of-summer Arctic sea ice extent reductions of about 10% per decade since 1979. Actually, 2007 set a new record. 2. Contiguous U.S. --The annual average temperature will be near 54.3 F or 1.5 degrees above the 20th century average, making 2007 the 8th warmest on record. --U.S. residential energy demand was 3% less in the winter which is good news, but it was 8% higher than average in the summer.

These cyclical influences can mask underlying warming trends with Prof. Phil Jones, Director of the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia, saying: \"The fact that 2008 is forecast to be cooler than any of the last seven years (and that 2007 did not break the record warmth set on 1998) does not mean that global warming has gone away. What matters is the underlying rate of warming - the period 2001-2007 with an average of 0.44 °C above the 1961-90 average was 0.21 °C warmer than corresponding values for the period 1991-2000.\" Here are some of the details from their 2008 forecast .............. -- Global average temperatures for 2008 would be 0.37 celsius (0.66 F) above the 30-year average of 14 celsius (57.2 F) from 1961-1990. --2008 will be the coolest year globally since 2000. --The forecast took into account the strengthening La Nina, which, according to the forecasters would limit the warming trend. Rising atmospheric greenhouse gases, solar variations and changes in ocean currents were also considered when making the forecast.

The small bright patch in the upper half, just left of center is the spot. According to solar physicist Douglas Biesecker of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the sunspot is an early omen of solar storms that will gradually increase over the next few years. Last April, experts predicted Solar Cycle 24 would start in March 2008 (+/- 6 months), and they were evenly split between those predicting a strong or weak cycle. All agreed that the sooner the new cycle takes over the waning cycle (becomes dominant), the more likely it would be a strong season with many sunspots and major storms. Some studies have shown a correlation between oscillations in solar activity with oscillations in global mean temperature on earth. The greater the solar activity and luminosity, the warmer our climate is. The new sunspot, according to the NOAA press release, is the latest visible spot to appear since NOAA began numbering them on January 5, 1972. Its high-latitude location at 27 degrees North, and its negative polarity leading to the right in the Northern Hemisphere are clear-cut signs of a new solar cycle, according to NOAA experts. The first active regions and sunspots of a new solar cycle can emerge at high latitudes while those from the previous cycle continue to form closer to the equator. Solar Cycle 24 is not dominant yet, as many more spots with Cycle 24 traits must appear.

According to Sorokhtin's article from the Russian News and Information Agency, data obtained from Habibullah Abdusamatov, who is the head of the Pulkovo Observatory space research laboratory, shows that a fairly cold spell will set in quite soon, by 2012, but real cold will come when solar activity reaches its minimum, by 2041, and will last for 50-60 years or longer. Sorokhtin also notes..... Carbon dioxide is not to blame for global climate change. Solar activity is many times more powerful than the energy produced by the whole of humankind. Man?s influence on nature is a drop in the ocean. Earth is unlikely to ever face a temperature disaster. The principal is Earth?s reflective power, which regulates its temperature. A warm period, as the present, increases oceanic evaporation to produce a great amount of clouds, which filter solar radiation and so bring heat down. Things take the contrary turn in a cold period.

Quotes taken from the Oregonian article ...... \"When an earthquake occurs, it makes a distinct sound, and we can locate that,\" says Robert Dziak, 44, OSU associate professor of marine geophysics and expedition leader. \"Earthquakes and magma spewing on the seafloor go hand in hand, and what we are seeing is, there are new heat sources right off the coast of Deception Island that no one was aware of before. \"It's the only place on the planet where active seafloor and subaerial (above sea level) volcanoes are near large icebergs and ice sheets.\" Dziak is hoping to learn more about how the sea floor volcanoes and earthquakes contribute to the breakup of ice in the region. The most significant find from the research so far has been the discovery of thermal vents on the seafloor. An underwater thermal vent. \"Since three-quarters of the Earth is covered by ocean, the vast majority of volcanic activity on Earth is occurring without our knowledge undersea.\" So it's unknown how much heat and chemicals the underwater volcanoes spew into the ocean and atmosphere, affecting global ocean temperatures and climate, said Dziak. According to Haru Matsumoto, research associate at OSU, scientists know that the air temperature around the Western Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by 4 degrees Fahrenheit during the past 40 years and that noise levels in the waters nearby have increased about 10 decibels in the past 30 years. The article states that Matsumoto's sound research has shown that the waters off Antarctica are quieter in the winter, when ice seals the water from external sounds, and noisier in the summer. He says the louder noise levels of the past four decades may be the result of global warming, and that ultimately could impact marine life.

The research team says that growing shinier crops could reduce maximum daytime temperatures by as much as 1.9 celsius (3.4 F) in agricultural regions. Growing more reflective plants will increase the amount of sunlight reflected back from land. which could offset the damaging effects of the loss of Arctic sea ice, according to the article from the Guardian Unlimited. The California team, led by Chris Doughty in the department of earth system science, told the American Geophysical Union Conference: \"Slowing or reversal of regional warming trends may be achieved by manipulation of land surface albedo. This approach is most feasible in agricultural and forestry areas, where the land surface is already under significant human influence.\" One example of this idea is the creation of the extra-hairy variety of soy bean to fight pests. This particular variety reflects about 5% more sunlight than normal. More details about this research will be published in an academic journal later this year. The story also notes that other scientists have proposed similar ideas (higher reflectivity) to cool the planet, such as growing broadleaf varieties of trees instead of conifers and painting roads, roofs and car parks white. I don't know about that idea of replacing conifers, supposedly conifers absorb a high amount of CO2, and those white roads would get awfully dirty looking pretty quickly! I guess that would keep the road sweeping crews very busy throughout the year.

He blames an economic system that rewards production without regard for environmental impact. In the Time.com article , Brown lays out an alternate path that could save us from the worst consequences of climate change, and he calls it Plan B. Here is a sampling of Brown's Plan B.......... 1. Winding down our dependence on coal and eventually phase it out. 2. Reduce global carbon dioxide emissions 80% by 2020. 3. Improve energy efficiency. 4. Develop renewable sources of power. 5. Expand the Earth's forest cover. 6. Build new wind turbines with the same urgency that the U.S. produced tanks and bombers during World War II and we could generate 3 million megawatts of wind power by 2020, enough to meet 40% of the world's energy needs. 7. Utilize more geothermal energy, which according to Brown is 50,000 times more powerful than all of our oil or natural gas. 8. Phase in a worldwide carbon tax at $20 per ton each year between 2008-2020, topping out at $240 per ton. How much would all of this cost? Brown estimates that the coast of his Plan B would cost the world an additional $190 billion per year. He compares this to the global military budget, which is more than $1.2 trillion. Brown feels that all we have to do is find the political and popular will to implement the plan, but that will be a tough sell, as the real battle over climate change is now political, not technological, and it's one that too many environmentalists tend to discount, according to the article.

I took over this blog back in January of 2007 and have truly enjoyed the experience. I have personally learned a great deal about climate change by researching many stories and studies, watching Katie's videos and the of course by reading your comments. I look forward to another year! Thank you! Now on to some bad news........ I do not watch 60 minutes that much anymore, there is just too much other good stuff that is on Sunday evening. My parents used to watch it all the time, and with one TV that is what I watched as well. Anyway, the show just happened to still be on when I came into the living room and a story about western wildfires was just starting, so I stayed and watched. The story focused on the recent increase in mega-fires across the forests of the western United States. Typical fires during the burn season are a common part of nature and are necessary in many cases. Forests and wildlife usually recover fairly quickly from these fires as most of the undergrowth is burned away while the large, older trees are able to survive. Unfortunately, fire ecologists have seen a marked increase in mega-fires across the West recently and are blaming global warming, since the warming has allowed logs, branches and tree needles to dry out faster and for a longer period of time. These mega-fires are huge and can \"kill\" a forest. The larger flames and higher heat from these fires can kill the large, old-growth trees and lead to sterile soil conditions, which prevent new growth after the fire. \"The fire season in the last 15 years or so has increased more than two months over the whole western U.S., said Tom Swetnam, fire ecologist at the University of Arizona. \"So actually 78 days on average longer fire season in the last 15 years compared to the previous 15-20 years.\" The strongest impact on me from the 60 Minutes story was the interview with Tom Boatner, the federal governments chief of fire operations, who has worked the fire lines for 30 years and has seen the change first hand. \"We're seeing century-old forests that had never sustained these kinds of fires before, being razed to the ground,\" said Boatner. The increase in mega-fires might not be all due to the warming. Forest fire management policy over the past 100 years has been to stop even small to moderate-size fires as fast as possible, which has resulted in a very large amount of forest undergrowth. The availability of this dry, undergrowth has added a lot more potential fuel than normal to these fires, increasing the chances of mega-fires. Swetnam says that there is a reasonable chance that more than half of the region's forests could be claimed by fire within some decades to a century as we continue to get large-scale fires.

Joe specializes in hurricane and long-range forecasting at AccuWeather.com. I thought his post from Tuesday would be of interest to the global warming crowd. Here is the full unedited post... Historic La Nina in the Making The current La Nina has briefly leveled off at -1.5 is about to turn down once again. The CFS model is catching this as it can see the renewed charge of cold water in Nino 1.2 region that is coming west. This is the revenge of the Thermohaline circulation and the big implication is that it is a kick in the teeth of people pushing man-made global warming. Why? Because this is exactly what should be happening in the natural cycle that develops when the AMO is in its warm state. It is the reason for why we see such powerful La Ninas; they are counterweights. But this one is very important for three reasons. 1) We may see the lowest recorded three-month mean in 3.4. The lowest I can find in the three-month running mean is -2.0. The CFS is forecasting -2.5. Since farther away from 0 it gets, the tougher it is, the forecast is suspect as -2.5. If it were baseball, it's like pitching back-to-back perfect games, possible, but not likely. First of all it has to hit -2.1, which would be the lowest and a record, that is perfect game one, then to keep falling is even more miraculous. However there is reason to believe it COULD happen, as we are seeing a pick-up of the easterlies and renewed cold water is coming from the east. I did not see the report mention the extremity of the forecast by the CFS, in terms of the La Nina, you are looking at the extreme let's say that the 1993 super-storm attained, an extreme COLD event, not ever recorded before. 2) The time it is forecasted. I have not seen a La Nina or for that matter and El Nino \"peak\" in the three-month period centered on March. The reason is the driving mechanisms that respond to the seasons can not sustain it. So the forecast is, if you will a third perfect game in a row, if it came true, the triple whammy of strongest ever, strongest by an unheard-of amount, and occurring at a time that has never happened before. The late Norm MacDonald would look at something like this and say ... that won't happen, because he had never seen it happen before, and then it wouldn't. So why should this? Well, that leads us into the next point. 3) Suppose it gets close or breaks it be a little bit. It is still a sign that the oceanic responses to the warming cycle is working! This is what happens in nature, so it's a major thorn in the side of people blaming people. There is not rout and the fight is one to take the earth back to where it was 25-30 years ago when the talk was of ice age (and it will be again). It is simple; look at history and one can see it. But suppose it is right, or close, the implication of this COLD event cannot be underestimated as far as what it means to global temps. This has to be factored into the entire system, and the development of questionable land-based data with suspect thermometers and heat islands has been given unearned credit in the global temps. But it's interesting to note how there is not a lot of attention being given to this La Nina as far as what the LONGER TERM CLIMATIC IMPLICATIONS ARE. It simply gets blamed for everything that goes wrong with the weather, and then somehow it's caused by global warming, which it is, but not human-induced, simply part of the natural cycle. Now why so strong? Well, the earthquake idea was laid out several months ago and is the reason why in spring, way back the hurricane conference, attendees heard my theory on a LATE STARTING LA NINA that would try to reach moderate levels at the end of the hurricane season. Let's go back and remember, all one needs to do is look at the ENSO archives, until middle and late summer, there was no forecast from the center of a La Nina, as it is now their ideas are still conservative given the audacity of the CFS. It's interesting to note that when the warm cycle of the El Nino was coming on, and we were taking apart the idea it would get that strong and in fact touting the reversal, there was talk of that becoming the strongest El Nino ever. However there is hardly a peep I can hear, though I am banging the drum, for what is looking more and more like an event that may make history. Now one may say this is all self-serving hogwash, but I say it is part of an idea that has to do with what that earthquake may have meant. Please go back through the archives and read that if you haven't. But let's take this a step further. Suppose the idea that the earthquake in some way delayed this La Nina by helping cause the last El Nino (one has to answer the question on the rapid SOI variances that followed for a year and a half, something jarred the weather) and the result was a damming up of the La Nina so that what should have started a bit earlier and not been as strong, literally snapped back strongly the other way so we are seeing this now. What would happen in the grander, longer-term forecast that lower solar constants that are anticipated as the century matures, increased volcanic activity because the signs are there, and the Earth's natural cycle fighting back, all acted together at once. The threat is the rubberband snaps and there is rapid cooling. The fact is the warmer it gets the harder it is to get warmer, unless there is some kind of increase in the total energy available. It is the huge hole in the cheese of the global warming argument, that there is only so much water vapor that can be held before there is condensation. And the more water vapor and warming, the more it will start to snow, maybe not down to sea level in Atlantic City, but in the arctic deserts (we are seeing that now) and in higher ground. The first step of the warming in the 30s was to dry things out and warm things up so much, there were articles in Denver newspapers in the late 30s that the glaciers would be gone within 10 years! This has happened before. But there was not the amount of rumblings we are hearing from people who study the sun for its possible reduction of radiation, though slight, has a major cumulative effect on a black body such as Earth, such as the opposite in the run up over the past years has had. And the wild card of volcanic activity is also a big problem. Scoff if you want, or close your mind to this, but these are things to think about. You see we are treading on uncharted ground now, or may be very soon, but it is a COLD EVENT in an ocean that may be the uncharted event, and such an event in the tropical Pacific takes out a major source region of heat, for the decrease of temperatures in a wet bulb area of 80 is far more important than an increase in wet bulb areas that are near and below 0! Years from now, when I have left the playing field, if I am right, then maybe you will be talking about these ideas to your children. But at the very least, what we all should do is constantly look with an open mind and try to reason out what we are seeing. Now many of you may be wondering, what is the bottom line of the longer-term forecast given this historic (hysteric?) idea? But that is not what this post is all about and this post should have raised enough eyebrows so that at the very least, you are curious enough to examine some of these ideas, and come up with what they may mean on your own. That is what open debate in a free society is all about, and what has made us find the right answer in so many things, even we rumble, bumble and stumble our way to it.

I have already replaced about 80% of my household lighting with the compact fluorescent ones and not one has burned out yet in 3 years. --The law creates a 15 billion gallon renewable fuels standard fro grain based fuels, which will be met primarily by corn based ethanol. \"The bill I sign today takes a significant step because it will require fuel producers to use at least 36 billion gallons of biofuel in 2022. This is nearly a fivefold increase over current levels,\" President Bush said. \"It will help us diversify our energy supplies and reduce our dependence on oil.\" Not everyone was happy with the passage of the bill........... Congressman Joe Barton (R-TX) said the measure would increase the cost of fuel, triggering a recession. \"The cost of building our homes is going to go up because of all the new building code restrictions for so-called ?green buildings' in this bill. The cost of electricity is going to go up. The cost of manufacturing our automobiles and our trucks is going to go up.\" \"The cost of appliances is going to go up because of all the new efficiency standards we're putting in for appliances. And even the cost of light bulbs is going to go up. The light bulbs that light this chamber right now will be illegal when this bill becomes totally implemented. The incandescent light bulb that you can get for 90 cents or 50 cents at Wal-Mart is going to be outlawed,\" said Barton. \"That's a cause for recession.\" On the other side....... \"The lighting section of the energy bill is a bright light in an otherwise underachieving piece of legislation,\" said Earth Day Network President Kathleen Rogers. \"Along with the requirement that automobile fleets average 35 miles per gallon and building efficiency improvements, Congress took a very modest step in the right direction, but sold out to the oil and gas industries by approving huge subsidies to companies that are experiencing record profits.\" What is your opinion of the new Energy Law?

This period, which saw rapid global warming, is seen as the best fossil analogue to predicted future climate trends, according to the Science Centric article . The Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum was caused by a relatively rapid increase increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, which was determined using sediments that accumulated 55 million years ago on the ocean floor in what is now New Jersey. Through a chain-reaction of events CO2 concentrations likely became higher through intense volcanism and warmed the planet as a result. This is interesting, as you would think the massive amounts of ash and dust particles released from all the eruptions would lead to a cooler planet, as we have documentated in much more recent history. Anyway, as a result, marine methane hydrates, which are ice-like structures, melted and released large amounts of methane into the atmosphere, which further accelerated the warming (positive feedback) since methane is a strong greenhouse gas. The end result was a 6 degree celsius increase in temperature. The research team says that the study confirms that climate warming can enforce mechanisms that inject massive amounts of stored carbon into the atmosphere and that current/future warming will likely see similar feedbacks.

Marine scientists from California have determined that the massive accumulations of the mineral barite on the bottom of the ocean indicates that the PETM was accompanied by several thousands of years of ocean plant life kicking into high gear. That massive increase in ocean plant life captured excessive carbon from the atmosphere and deposited it to the ocean floor where it was buried. Barite, otherwise known as barium sulfate, is a good indicator of ocean plant productivity according to Adina Paytan, an oceanographer at the University of California. When organisms in the life-rich upper waters die, they sink to the sea floor along with the barium since all living things contain a lot of barium in their tissues. In very deep water, the barium reaches its saturation point in the water and combines with sulfur to create the mineral barite. According to the study, the large accumulations of barite may very well indicate that the direct products of living organisms may have cooled the atmosphere during the PETM. \"This study is suggesting that the peaks in barite observed in the deep sea...are accurately reflecting changes in the accelerated, though temporary, sequestration of carbon by one process -- higher algal production,\" PETM expert James Zachos told Discovery News. That doesn't mean Earth is likely to repair the damage done by current global warming in any timely way, however, he cautions According to Zachos, the accumulation of barite went on for 170,000 years, which indicates that it takes much, much longer to cool off a hot earth than to heat up a cool planet.

Here's the latest........ --Moderate-strength La Nina currently across the tropical Pacific. --NOAA predicts continued La Nina conditions through Spring 2008. Current sea surface anomalies from the Pacific, courtesy of NOAA. (Note the large area of colder than normal sea surface water covering a large part of the equatorial Pacific). Stronger than normal easterly winds over the region push warmer surface waters westward, while allowing colder water to upwell from the South American Pacific coast and expand westward near and along the equator. The latest Outgoing Longwave Radiation anomaly (OLR) image below indicates a large area of suppressed precipitation/convection (orange shading) along the equator between 150 east and 145 west longitude. --Stronger than normal easterly low-level winds (consistent with La Nina) are present over the central and western equatorial Pacific as shown by the purple shading in the graphic below. --The current Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) for the Sep-Nov 2007 time period is -1.1 celsius. The value is the sea surface temperature departure from average in the Nino 3.4 region and is the principle measure for monitoring ENSO. The ONI value for a La Nina needs to be -0.5 celsius or less, while the value for an El Nino needs to be +0.5 celsius or greater. The lowest ONI value in recent time was -2.0. Here is a link to the historical ONI index. The graphic below shows the Nino regions. --There must be 5 consecutive overlapping 3-month seasons to be considered a full fledged La Nina or El Nino. So far for this current La Nina we are up to 3, but it is just a matter of time. --ENSO models predict La Nina to continue into the spring. --The latest CFS forecasts predict the La Nina to further strengthen and perhaps reach record level by spring (-2.8 by March from the ensemble mean forecast shown by the thicker blue line in the graph below). Joe Bastardi alluded to this in his post last week. Keep in mind though, I have seen these forecasts bust pretty badly over the past several years. Nothing is certain. What could this mean for the weather patterns across North America the rest of this winter if these ENSO forecasts hold true? --Very strong Pacific jet stream should deliver many more storms to the West coast, especially from northern California up through southern BC. --Arctic air only makes brief visits into the lower 48 and pretty much hangs out from Alaska through northern Canada and down toward northern BC and Alberta. --Southeastern U.S. high pressure ridge stays strong and keeps much of the southern states warmer than normal, with the Southeast remaining drier than normal. --Central Plains to the Northeast U.S. milder than normal. --Midwest/Great Lakes into Ontario/Quebec continue to see more storms than normal, but even though it's milder than normal snowfall remains above-normal.

Well, according to NASA, it appears that Cycle 24 might have started on December 11th. \"New solar cycles always begin with a high-latitude, reversed polarity sunspot,\" explains David Hathaway of the Marshall Space Flight Center. \"Reversed polarity\" means a sunspot with opposite magnetic polarity compared to sunspots from the previous solar cycle. \"High-latitude\" refers to the sun's grid of latitude and longitude.

Ozone measurements from the ship in late April of 2007 found virtually no ice-level ozone for a 15+ day period, which is measured in the first 100-200 meters of air. According to the BBC News article , ice-level ozone falls victim to reactive bromine atoms released naturally from briny Arctic waters. The scientists speculate that a warming Arctic would lead to more slushy ice, which could assist in the release of bromine, resulting in even longer periods of ozone loss, limiting the region's ability to deal with pollutants in the atmosphere. \"Ozone is the source for the 'vacuum cleaner of the atmosphere' - the molecule OH.

There was also another letter to the United Nations, that was signed by nearly 200 scientists which strongly urged immediate action by leading goverments to combat global warming. To be fair, I should have linked to both letters in the initial blog, which would have provided a more balanced post in which you could compare the letters. To make up for my mistake, here is a summary of what was written in that letter...... The letter starts out by addressing the 2007 IPCC report which states that we are now at least 90% certain that human activities are contributing to a warming planet and that many millions of people will be at risk from extreme events if the trend is not halted soon. --The letter states that global greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by 50% below their 1990 levels by 2050. --Greenhouse gas emissions in the long run need to be stabilized at a level well below 450 ppm. --Global emissions must peak and decline in the next 10-15 years in order to stay below the expected 2 degrees celsius increase. TalkClimateChange.com did a nice post a couple days ago in comparing the two letters. Here is the link. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here is the earlier post from Saturday which I titled \"Attempting to stop Global Warming is Futile and a Mistake, says letter to the UN Global warming is a natural phenomenon that has affected humanity through the ages and it is not possible to stop climate change. The Bali and the IPCC process is a mistake, and will ultimately be futile. These are the conclusions from an open letter to the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, which was signed by more than 100 specialists from around the world with expertise ranging from climate science to economics and biology. The letter , which was assembled by Robert M. Carter, professor at the Marime Geophysical Laboratory of James Cook University in Australia, argues against the existence of consensus and rejects claims of abnormal climate change. The letter also disputes the IPCC process and claims new research has emerged making the IPCC reports \"materially oudated\". The IPCC's Summaries for Policy Makers are the most commonly read IPCC reports among politicians and non-scientists, yet, according to the letter, these summaries are prepared by a small core writing team with final drafts approved by government representatives. A great majority of IPCC contributers, reviewers and other qualified scientists are not involved in the preparation of the documents. The letter, which was posted on the National Post from Canada, also states that the IPCC's conclusions are quite inadequate as justification for implementing policies that will markedly diminish future prosperity. Also, it is not established that it is possible to significantly alter global climate through cuts in human greenhouse gas emissions. By the way, one of the signers to this letter was Dr. Fred Singer, who is featured today in a video question and answer with our own Katie Fehlinger just below.

This drop in sea surface temperature may have contributed to the difference in hurricane activity between the two seasons. There were 15 hurricanes in the Atlantic Basin in 2005, but only 5 in 2006 as the sea surface temperatures remained relatively cool. By the way, this past season also saw less activity than what was earlier predicted. Satellite view of Saharan Dust covering the Caribbean According to the study by William Lau and Kyu-Myong Kim from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the dust effectively blocked sunlight from reaching the sun's surface and accounted for a 30-40% drop in temperature during the period. The actual drop in the North Atlantic was between 0.37 and 0.72 degrees F., or one-third of the total sea surface cooling of the North Atlantic. \"Previous studies have looked at how hot, dry air associated with a Saharan dust outbreak affects an individual storm, but our study is the first to focus on dust's radiative effect on sea surface temperatures, which may affect storms for the entire season.

Scientists who denied a link between stronger hurricanes and global warming were given approval by CEQ over scientists who suggested a link. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, White House approval for interviews with journalists became more prevalent. The committee obtained 27,000 documents from the CEQ during the investigation.

I hated sun bathing, so my place was in the water. Other than a thunderstorm and those dreaded crabs, the one thing that could ruin a nice swim in the bay was the seaweed. That stuff would just magically appear from out of the blue and just surround you, and by that time I was done for the day. I also remember throwing the stuff at my older sister and she would start screaming, which was funny at the time. Anyway, speaking of seaweed, a group of scientists at the Climate Conference in Bali believe that seaweed could be a potent weapon against global warming by sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere at rates similar to the largest rain forests, according to an AP article . The seaweed's rapid rate of photosynthesis is the main factor in its effectiveness in carbon absorption. While most of the recent focus to carbon sinks have been on the forests, seaweed scientists (I still can not get over that title! Imagine your dad asking \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" \"I want to be a seaweed scientist daddy!\") believe the world should look to the sea, where nearly 8 million tons of seaweed and algae are cultivated every year, especially in Asia. The scientists believe that more efficient cultivation methods could make this work. Seaweed can also produce clean-burning bio-fuels. On the other hand, skeptics say seaweed is cultivated and harvested in cycles of only months compared to trees, which are more effective at carbon storage since they can last for years. Floating seaweed farms could also complicate fishing and shipping activities. Update........

Warmer oceans due to global warming are generally assumed to provide a more favorable environment for hurricane development and intensification, but according to the study from the journal Nature, other factors such as atmospheric temperature and moisture come into play, which in my opinion is fairly obvious to a meteorologist. Anyway, Dr. Gabriel Vecchi from NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and Brian J. Soden from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science went further and explored the relationship between changes in sea surface temperature and tropical cyclone \"potential intensity\", which is a measure that provides an upper limit on cyclone (hurricane) intensity. Excerpts taken from the Science Daily article ......... They found that warmer oceans do not alone produce a more favorable environment for storms because the effect of remote warming can counter, and sometimes overwhelm, the effect of local surface warming. \"Warming near the storm acts to increase the potential intensity of hurricanes, whereas warming away from the storms acts to decrease their potential intensity,\" Vecchi said. Their study found that long-term changes in potential intensity are more closely related to the regional pattern of warming than to local ocean temperature change. Regions that warm more than the tropical average are characterized by increased potential intensity, and vice versa. \"A surprising result is that the current potential intensity for Atlantic hurricanes is about average, despite the record high temperatures of the Atlantic Ocean over the past decade.\" Soden said. \"This is due to the compensating warmth in other ocean basins.\" \"If the Atlantic warms more slowly than the rest of the tropical oceans, we would expect a decrease in the upper limit on hurricane intensity,\" Vecchi added.

Actually, according to professor Wieslaw Maslowski, a researcher from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, the 2013 projection does not even take into account the last two Arctic sea ice minima seasons of 2005 and 2007, since the study used data sets from 1979-2004 to make their future projections. \"So given that fact, you can argue that may be our projection of 2013 is already too conservative,\" said Maslowski. Maslowski believes other, more conservative model projections seriously underestimated the amount of heat delivered to the sea ice by oceanic advection, such as how warm water is moving into the Arctic basin from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. According to the study from the BBC article , it has become apparent in recent years that the real, observed rate of summer ice melting is now starting to run well ahead of the models. Arctic ice expert, professor Peter Wadhams from Cambridge University, UK has used sonar data collected by submarines to show that the volume loss is outstripping even area withdrawal, which agrees with Maslowski's work. \"The ice is thinning faster than it is shrinking; and some modellers have been assuming the ice was a rather thick slab,\" said Wadhams. \"The implication is that this is not a cycle, not just a fluctuation.

What is noteworthy, according to Hansen, is the fact that the unusual warmth in 2007 occurred when solar irradiance is at a minimum and the Pacific has entered the cool phase, La Nina cycle. In the analysis from Hansen's website , Hansen believes 2007 will remain in second place after the full year is taken into account, but there is also the slight chance that it could slip to third if December is unusally cold. According to the GISS analysis.......... --The global mean temperature so far this year is running almost 1 degree F. (0.6 C) above normal. --The greatest warming this year has been in the Arctic. --The cooler, Pacific equatorial region west of South America shown on the temperature anomaly map reflects the building La Nina phase of the southern oscillation. Hansen believes the natural variations of the southern oscillation and the solar cycle have minor, but not entirely insignificant effects on year-to year temperature change. Barring the unlikely event of a large volcanic eruption, a record global temperature exceeding that of 2005 can be expected within the next 2-3 years. Hansen also acknowledges a minor data processing error in the GISS temperature analysis in early 2007, which he says does not affect the present analysis. The error impacted only 1.6% of the earth's surface and the error was immeasurable globally (~0.003 degrees C).

Adding iron and other nutrients to produce large algae blooms in the ocean, which would absorb carbon dioxide has been a well known possible solution to global warming and has been talked about on this blog several times. According to the ScienceDaily article , this process only reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide if the carbon absorbed into the algae sinks to deeper waters, which scientists call the \"biological pump.\" The theory of the process is that the more algae in bloom the more carbon is transported from the atmosphere to the deep ocean, via the \"biological pump.\" Here's where it gets interesting, during the process of testing the theory the researchers determined that there are clear seasonal patterns in both algal abundance and carbon sinking rates. But one thing about this relationship caught the research team by surprise, and it was that less carbon was transported to deep water during summertime bloom than the rest of the year! \"This discovery is very surprising\", said lead author Dr. Michael Lutz, now at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. \"If, during natural plankton blooms, less carbon actually sinks to deep water than during the rest of the year, then it suggests that the Biological Pump leaks. More material is recycled in shallow water and less sinks to depth, which makes sense if you consider how this ecosystem has evolved in a way to minimize loss\", said Lutz. \"Ocean fertilization schemes, which resemble an artificial summer, may not remove as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as has been suggested because they ignore the natural processes revealed by this research.\" The study concludes that greatly enhanced carbon sequestration should not be expected no matter the location or duration of proposed large-scale ocean fertilization experiments. This study is no doubt a win for environmentalists, who had major concerns about a large-scale project such as this. Maybe even some taxpayer relief as well!

The team compared upper-air measurements and computer model simulations to come this conclusion. Some observational studies have already found a widening of the tropics by several degrees latitude since 1979, according to the NOAA article. \"We looked at how certain aspects of the structure and circulation of the atmosphere have been altered over the past few decades and how models predict they may change as the climate changes in the future,? said Dian Seidel, lead author and research meteorologist with NOAA?s Air Resources Laboratory in Silver Spring, Md. ?We are seeing indications that a warming climate is associated with expansion of the tropical region toward the poles, and the rate of expansion that has occurred in recent decades is greater than projected by climate models to occur in the 21st century.\" Keep in mind, there are still a lot of unanswered questions as to what specific global warming mechanisms are causing this expansion.

In the Boston Globe article written by John Donnelly, Mr. Donald S. Burke, dean of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, noted that a 2001 study found that weather fluctuation and seasonal variability may influence the spread of infectious disease. But he believes that such conclusions should be interpreted with caution. \"There are no apocalyptic pronouncements,\" Burke said. \"There's an awful lot we don't know.\" Burke said he is not convinced that climate change can be proven to cause the spread of many diseases, specifically naming dengue fever, influenza, and West Nile virus. On the other hand, you have Paul R. Epstein, associate director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, who said clusters of disease outbreaks spread by water, mosquitoes, and rats could clearly be traced to global warming. Epstein said those who \"just look at specific diseases can miss the broader picture. If you look at ecological systems, water systems, the extreme weather, the range of wildlife . . . or more profoundly everything that supports a health system, then you can see the linkages. Scope is really important when you look at this.\" An example of a documented link of disease to a chnaging weather pattern was exhibited by an earlier outbreak of chikungunya fever along Kenya's coast. Weather patterns caused by La Nina led to drought in east Africa during 2004. Because there was a shortage of fresh water, people rarely emptied buckets around their homes, giving mosquitoes an ideal breeding ground of standing water. \"An outbreak like that is from a convergence of factors, and climate is one of them,\" said Jean-Paul Chretien, who is the Defense Department's coordinator of overseas laboratories.

You can track sunspot activity on a daily basis After a period of very high solar activity (high numbers of sunspots) in the 20th century, our sun has suddenly gone exceptionally quiet, according to astronomer Dr. David Whitehouse. We are currently at the end of one cycle of activity and astronomers keep waiting for the sunspots to return and mark the start of the next cycle 24, but so far there has been no sign of that returning anytime soon. Excerpts taken from Dr. Whitehouse's article, which was posted on the online version of The Independent........... Sunspots - dark magnetic blotches on the Sun's surface - come and go in a roughly 11-year cycle of activity first noticed in 1843. It's related to the motion of super-hot, electrically charged gas inside the Sun - a kind of internal conveyor belt where vast sub-surface rivers of gas take 40 years to circulate from the equator to the poles and back. Somehow, in a way not very well understood, this circulation produces the sunspot cycle in which every 11 years there is a sunspot maximum followed by a minimum. But recently the Sun's internal circulation has been failing. In May 2006 this conveyor belt had slowed to a crawl ? a record low. Nasa scientist David Hathaway said: \"It's off the bottom of the charts... this has important repercussions for future solar activity.\" What's more, it's not the only indicator that the Sun is up to something. During the 17th century Maunder Minimum, when sunspots were rare, it was also the period of time when the earth's northern hemisphere was sent into what scientists call the \"Little Ice Age.\" Studies show that by the end of the 20th century the Sun's activity may have been at its highest for more than 8,000 years. Other solar parameters have been changing as well, such as the magnetic field the Sun sheds, which has almost doubled in the past century. But then things turned. In only the past decade or so the Sun has started a decline in activity, and the lateness of cycle 24 is an indicator. The first stirrings of cycle 24 were supposed to arrive a year ago, then NOAA predicted it for March 2007, now they say March of 2008. The first indications that the Sun is emerging from its current sunspot minimum will be the appearance of small spots at high latitude. They usually occur some 12-20 months before the start of a new cycle. These spots haven't appeared yet so cycle 24 will probably not begin to take place until 2009 at the earliest, according to Whitehouse. The longer we have to wait for cycle 24, the weaker it is likely to be. Such behaviour is usually followed by cooler temperatures on Earth. The tardiness of cycle 24 indicates that we might be entering a period of low solar activity that may counteract man-made greenhouse temperature increases. Some members of the Russian Academy of Sciences say we may be at the start of a period like that seen between 1790 and 1820, a minor decline in solar activity called the Dalton Minimum. They estimate that the Sun's reduced activity may cause a global temperature drop of 1.5C by 2020. This is larger than most sensible predictions of man-made global warming over this period. Again, you can read the whole story here . Also at the end, Dr. Whitehouse has a list of the past seasons of the sun going back 1000 years.

The research team used climate models to examine future weather conditions favorable to the formation of severe thunderstorms, according to the ScienceDaily article . \"Areas close to the main sources of humidity, primarily the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, show the most significant increases in potential for storms,\" said Robert Trapp, the Purdue associate professor of earth and atmospheric sciences who led the research team. \"We know from the past that extremes in weather and individual severe storms can be devastating. This study makes a strong statement that a few degrees of global warming could make these severe events much more common than they are today,\" said Noah Diffenbaugh from Purdue's Climate Change Research Center. Individual storms were not examined in this study because they are too small for the current climate models to analyze, and also a trigger is needed to initiate a storm, according to team member Harold Brooks from the Severe Storms Laboratory. Research suggested global warming would lead to an increase in humid air that fuels severe thunderstorms, however, it also suggested global warming would reduce strong winds that contribute to the storms. \"The result was a general increase in days more favorable to storm creation. It appears that the increase in warm, humid air near the surface outweighs the reduction in strong winds higher in the atmosphere,\" said Diffenbaugh.

The above new image, from the NASA earth Observatory website , shows the long-term changes in yearly surface temperature in and around Antarctica between 1981 and 2007. Places that have warmed are red, while places that have cooled during the period are blue. (Note: most of you should be happy that there are no big red or blue dots on this map!) The darkest red areas may be linked to major iceberg calving events, which exposed new areas of open water. How were these measurements taken? They were made by using thermal infrared heat observations made by a series of NOAA Satellite sensors. The image shows trends in skin temperatures, which are the temperature measurements from the top millimeter of the land, sea ice or sea surface, but not the air temperature. Unfortunately, according to the article, each sensor has its own quirks and may measure temperatures a bit different, which is part of the reason why scientists estimate the level of uncertainty in the measurements is between 2 and 3 degrees celsius, which is pretty high and does not give me a lot of confidence in the accuracy of this map.

Remember, the IPCC shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore. --The report concludes that it is \"unequivocal\" that Earth's climate is warming. --The report finds that it is \"very likely\" (that's >90% likelyhood based on the chart) that emissions of heat-trapping gases from human activities have caused most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century, which is a stronger statement than the prior assessments. --Studies confirm that current carbon dioxide and methane (heat trapping gases) exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years. --11 of the last 12 years rank among the 12 hottest years on record (since 1850). --Tropical cyclone intensity has increased over the past 30 years and this correlates to increases in tropical sea surface temperatures. --There have been longer and more intense droughts, especially in the tropics and subtropics. --Since 1900 the northern hemisphere has lost 7% of the maximum area covered by seasonally frozen ground. --Sea levels continue to rise. The future? According to the story from the Union of Concerned Scientists, the IPCC assessment said that if we take no action to reduce emissions there will be twice as much warming over the next two decades than if we had stabilized heat-trapping gases and other climate revelent pollutants in the atmosphere at their year 2000 levels. --The full range of the predicted global temperature increase by the end of the century has been expanded. The new predicted full range is (+2 to +11.5 F increase in temperature). Wow, they covered themselves pretty well there! --The best estimate for the temperature increase by the end of the century is (+3.1 to +7.2 F) --Most of the warming will be over land and at most high northern latitudes. --Expect more frequent and severe tropical cyclones and heat waves. --Increasing carbon dioxide concentration will lead to increasing acidification of the oceans.

Researchers conducted two large forest experiments in which poplar trees were separated into two plots, with one plot exposed to ambient levels of carbon dioxide and the other exposed to elevated levels. (The elevated concentration was 550 parts per million?the predicted atmospheric level for 2050?while current ambient levels of carbon dioxide are 375 parts per million.) The researchers found that trees exposed to elevated levels of carbon dioxide retained their leaves and stayed greener longer than those exposed to ambient levels. Study author Gail Taylor said that the research data provided compelling evidence that leaf color change in forest ecosystems will be delayed as the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide continues to rise, independent of increased temperatures. The results are detailed in an online edition of the journal Global Change Biology.

A group of scientists from India believe that nuclear desalination is the answer. \"Nuclear energy seawater desalination has a tremendous potential for the production of freshwater,\" according to Meenaleshi Jain of CDM and Environmental Services and Positive Climate Care Pvt. Ltd in Jaipur. How would this work? Floating nuclear plants would represent a way to produce electrical energy, with minimal environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Plants could be sited well offshore anywhere there is dense coastal population. In addition to providing cheap electricity, the nuclear plants would also power a desalination plant with their excess heat, according to S.S. Verma from SLIET. The article from Water Online also noted........ A. Raha and colleagues at the Desalination Division of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, in Trombay, point out that Low-Temperature Evaporation (LTE) desalination technology utilizing low-quality waste heat in the form of hot water (as low as 50 Celsius) or low-pressure steam from a nuclear power plant has been developed to produce high-purity water directly from seawater. Safety, reliability, viable economics, have already been demonstrated. BARC itself has recently commissioned a 50 tons per day low-temperature desalination plant. Co-editor of the journal, B.M. Misra, formerly head of BARC, suggests that solar, wind, and wave power, while seemingly cost effective approaches to desalination, are not viable for the kind of large-scale fresh water production that an increasingly industrial and growing population needs.

The widespread damage led to these forests releasing large quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Young forests play an important role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. A major hurricane like this can kill large numbers of trees, and thus temporarily reduce photsynthesis. All dead wood will be consumed by decomposers, resulting in a large carbon dioxide release to the atmosphere, as the ecosystem exhales it as forest waste product for years to come, according to the NASA article . The research team studied Landsat 5 satellite data before and after the hurricane to get a good sampling of tree deaths. The team calculated total carbon losses to be equivalent to 60-100% of the net annual carbon sink in the U.S. forest trees! \"It is surprising to learn that one extreme event can release nearly as much carbon to the atmosphere as all U.S. forests can store in an average year,\" said Diane Wickland, manager of the Terrestrial Ecology Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

That 1.3% increase is down from a 1.6% annual growth estimate issued in December 2006 as the company now has expectations that automakers and airlines will introduce more efficient engines during the next 20 years. Based on that forecast, the company sees carbon dioxide emissions rising at a rate of 2% a year, which is mostly based on the expectation of developing nations' heavy reliance on coal to fuel their expanding industrial economies. I really can't argue with that forecast, especially when you consider the very high and growing populations in these developing countries and the coal situation, which I just blogged about in the last post. The company also predicts a 9% increase per year in the demand for renewable sources of energy, such as wind, solar and biofuels. With that increase, renewable fuels will still hold a very small piece (only 2%) of the world's energy demand pie by 2030.

A large group of international oceanographers just recently finished deploying 3000 robots, which will observe the effect of climate change on the world's oceans in real time, according to an article from ABCNews in Australia. The robots are called Argo floats. The Argo float, which is 1.5 meters tall, (~ 5 feet) is dropped to depths as much as of two kilometers (a little over a mile) below the surface and measures temperature, salinity and pressure. After the data is collected, the robot pops up to the surface and sends the data back via satellite to control centers in the U.S. and France. With the full deployment, data from every ocean on the globe will be available with average coverage of one robot per 3 degrees latitude and longitude. According to professor Dean Roemmich from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in California, Argo is similar to the real-time satellite analysis of the surface waters, which meteorologists such as yours truly depend upon during a regular basis. The difference is that Argo is looking at the sub-surface ocean, which gives scientists a better understanding of how global warming is affecting the world's oceans. Argo data might also help scientists better predict intensity of tropical cyclones by improved measurements of the heat content of the waters that a storm is about to move over. Scientists in Australia also think that the Argo could help them predict upcoming drought.

A team of NASA and University of Washington scientists have detected an ongoing reversal in the Arctic Ocean circulation which is triggered by atmospheric circulation changes that vary on decade-long time scales. What does this mean? It means that the scientists have determined that not all off the large changes in the Arctic climate that we have seen in recent years are a result of long-term trends associated with global warming. The study was done by looking at data from 2002-2006 which measured changes in weight of columns of Arctic Ocean water from the surface to the bottom. The weight is influenced by factors such as the height of the ocean's surface and its salinity. A saltier ocean is heavier and circulates differently than one with less salt. The results of the study suggested that the Arctic Ocean circulation (AO) changed from the counter-clockwise pattern exhibited in the 1990s to the clockwise pattern, which by the way was the dominant circulation prior to 1990. The authors of the study attributed the reversal to a weakened AO, which is a large atmospheric circulation pattern in the far northern hemisphere. The weakening AO reduced the salinity of the upper ocean near the north pole, decreasing its weight and thus changing the ocean's circulation. \"Our study confirms many changes seen in upper Arctic Ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature, rather than trends caused by global warming,\" said team leader James Morison. \"The winter of 2006-2007 was another high AO year and summer sea ice extent reached a new minimum,\" he said. \"It is too early to say, but it looks as though the Arctic Ocean is ready to start swinging back to the counterclockwise circulation pattern of the 1990s again.\" Here is the link to the story on the NASA news website.

The carbon absorption by vegetation, primarily in the form of forest growth, is expected to decline as maturing forests grow more slowly and take up less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.The conversion of fossil fuels to energy is the single highest contributor with transportation second. Report authors find it unclear how rapidly this carbon storage ?sink? will decline and whether it might potentially become a source since changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide could affect forest growth differently in different regions.

About ten years ago the cost of coal and oil was about the same, but now, West Texas Intermediate crude is five times more expensive than coal. Coal use worldwide has grown 27% since 2002, which is three times faster than crude, and the three biggest U.S. coal companies forecast the largest increase in exports in 20 years. \"Coal is by far the cheapest fuel because there's no price on how much damage it causes,\" said John Holdren, a Harvard University professor of environmental science and director of the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts. \"Unless you get policies to put a price on carbon dioxide and other emissions, no other plants can compete.\" Five months ago Al Gore said the U.S. should adopt a \"complete moratorium\" on new coal-fed power plants unless all of the CO2 from them can be buried underground. Based on what is going on now, it seems like Gore's proposal has little chance of getting enacted anytime soon. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 1,000 coal-fed power plants will be built in the next 5 years, mostly in China and India. \"If those 1,000 plants get built without any controls on carbon emissions, we will careen into unmanageable changes in our climate,\" said Holdren.

The size of the hole was pretty average compared to the last 15 years, but very big when compared to the 1970's, when the hole did not yet exist. From the NASA Earth Observatory News : The reason the ozone hole peaks in size during early Southern Hemisphere spring is that chemical reactions that create ozone-destroying chemicals like chlorine gas (two joined chlorine atoms) occur on the surface of droplets in polar stratospheric clouds, and these clouds form mostly during the dark, frigid polar winter. When sunlight returns to the Southern Hemisphere in spring, ultraviolet light splits the chlorine gas molecules into single chlorine atoms. Each single atom can catalyze the destruction of thousands of ozone molecules. As spring advances, wind patterns change. Air from lower latitudes mixes into the polar region, the chlorine gas disperses, and the ozone layer stabilizes until the next spring. Even though the production of ozone-destroying CFC's has stopped, there is a lag in the recovery of the ozone, since atmospheric CFC's have a lifetime of 40-100 years, so full recovery is not expected till 2070, but that is far from certain, especially when things such as global warming may have to be factored in. What impact could global warming have on the ozone hole? Well, it seems that I found two differing opinions on this. According to the NASA Earth Observatory story, warming over the South Pole could speed up the recovery. Now are they talking about warming in the stratosphere or troposphere? They are not specific. Assuming they are talking about the stratosphere means that the troposphere would be getting colder, which is opposite of global warming. I found a couple of other links which state the global warming will increase ozone depletion. Ozone depletion gets worse when the stratosphere (where the ozone layer is) gets colder. Global warming traps heat underneath in the troposphere, while at the same time less heat reaches the stratosphere, making it colder, and therefore more condusive to ozone destruction.

Mr. Gourevitch who did not portray himself as a skeptic of climate change explained his thesis............. Environmentalism is a politics of fear. It is not a progressive politics. When I say it is a politics of fear, I don't mean that it just deploys hysterical rhetoric or that it exaggerates threats, which I think it does. I mean it in a much deeper sense. Gourevitch quoted Al Gore as describing the climate change not only as the most urgent issue of our time, but also as a unique opportunity for current generations to affect the course of history. Gourevitch stated that this approach by Gore as \"the thrill of being forced by circumstances to put aside the pettiness and conflict that so often stifle the human need for transcendence.\" Chad Harbach, the managing editor of n+1 disagreed with some of Gourevitch's arguments....\"I would characterize this as the opposite of a politics of fear,\" Mr. Harbach said, saying that Mr. Friedman's arguments actually assuage fears even if they provide a \"false security.\" Mr. Harbach warned that America's greatest fear is really not climatic catastrophe but rather a future without cheap fuel and constant economic expansion. Harbach noted the thoughts of NY Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman, who has argued that investing in research and technology, along with developing new energy sources has the potential to create wealth and prosperity.

According to the Telegraph article , the final IPCC assessment continues to say that the Arctic will be devastated by rising temperatures, but that the Antarctic will be spared the worst of global warming, as Antarctica's ice sheets will remain too cold for widespread melting before the end of the century and may even grow as more snow accumulates.

As the tropical atmosphere warms, cirrus clouds decrease, which allows more infrared heat to escape from the atmosphere to outer space. Dr. Roy Spencer, a principle research scientist at UAH, was surprised by the results. \"The big question that no one can answer right now is whether this enhanced cooling mechanism applies to global warming,\" said Spencer.

The study, posted in the journal Nature used a computer model to simulate the carbon balance of one million square kilometers of the Canadian forest over the past 60 years, to determine the relative impacts of climate and disturbance by wildfire. The researchers found that the effects of CO2 and climate (temperature/precipitation) varied from year to year, but generally balanced out over time and area. According to The ScienceDaily version , the researchers believe that fires shift the carbon balance in multiple ways, a couple such as the burning of organic matter which quickly releases large amounts of CO2 and the fact that after a fire the forest canopy will allow more sun to reach and warm the ground, speeding decomposition and CO2 emission from the soil. According to S. Tom Gower, a UW-Madison professor of forest ecology, the boreal forest has been thought as a carbon sink historically, but based on the new study the forest has become a smaller sink and may actually be shifting toward becoming a carbon source. Though the model is not currently designed to forecast future conditions, Gower says, \"Based on our current understanding, fire was a more important driver (of the carbon balance) than climate was in the last 50 years.

According to the article , the ocean has a tendency to take up more carbon as the CO2 concentration in the air rises, because of Henry's Law, which states that in equilibrium, more in the air means more dissolved in the water. But, if you have warming at the surface then there tends to be some stratification of the ocean water (more warm and cold layers, which create barriers to water mixing). Less mixing means less replenishing of the surface waters by deep waters, which will mean less CO2 absorption. As I have stated in earlier pieces, the combination of the land biosphere and the oceans take up more than 1/2 of the carbon emission on the planet, but if climate change were to slow the uptake or even reverse it, then, according to the RealClimate story, climate forcing from fossil fuels would accelerate (positive feedback). A study done by Le Quere et al. from 2007 found that the southern ocean has begun to actually release carbon since about 1990. The researchers believe this could be due to a windier Southern Ocean, as the wind can open ventilation channels between the atmosphere and deep ocean. The ventilation channels would let the high concentrations of CO2 from the deep oceans to ventilated out into the atmosphere. But, these same ventilation channels could end up letting atmospheric carbon in as the atmospheric CO2 concentration supposedly gets higher (back to Henry's Law). A decrease in the North Atlantic Ocean uptake is also shown by the recent study from Schuster and Watson (2007), which I recently blogged about on October 22nd. (You will have to scroll down to the 22nd to see it) After reading the story, it is obvious that there are still a lot of unanswered questions about the impact of climate change on carbon cycle feedback. As the story says, it is still poorly understood.

The two combined typically absorb 1/2 of the CO2 into the atmosphere, but a 10-year study by researchers from the University of East Anglia showed that the uptake of CO2 by the North Atlantic Ocean halved between the mid 1990's and 2002-2005, which could accelerate global warming. There was also evidence of this trend in the southern Ocean, but not as great or as sudden, according to the Reuters article The findings surprised lead authors Dr. Ute Schuster and Professor Andrew Watson . \"We expected that the uptake would change only slowly because of the ocean's great mass,\" said Schuster. The data for the study was collected by specifically equipped merchant ships. The scientists are still not sure why this is happening, but according to Professor Watson it could be partly a natural oscillation or a response to recent rapid global warming.

I did a blog not too long ago on this same subject, and if you do not remember, adding iron in the ocean would increase the growth of phytoplankton and other CO2 reducing plants, which in turn could reduce CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere.

Her testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee had much less information on health risks than a much longer draft version Gerberding submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review in advance of her appearance, as the AP article reported .

We would also like to hear your feedback. Do you agree or disagree with what Joe is saying? Katie also discusses a new climate change bill that might have a chance of getting through Congress. Weather Forecast | Weather Maps | Weather Radar UPDATE........ In Joe Bastardi's column from Wednesday night he voices his frustration about the idea that global warming is being blamed for so many disasters lately. An interesting read....here it is It's simply astounding how when anything out of the ordinary happens, global warming is blamed. That leaders of this nation can, within a period of 24 hours, make such pronouncements about the wildfires ought to instantly call into account their reasons for such things. How can you come so quickly to such a conclusion? Have you researched all this? For instance the hidden reason for the SoCal drought may be because the water is so darn cold off SoCal this year, much below normal, it is leading to large-scale sinking that is retarding precip. The amount of cold water showing up in the Pacific now certainly is helping tip the balance away from the warmth over land in the means. So we are dealing with a case of anomalously cold water leading to the dryness that can set this up. Perhaps, with arson suspected in some of these fires, we will blame global warming for driving people to such things, setting fires. Let's take the problem with Delaware River flooding that seems to be more common. Global warming is being blamed by many of the people on the river, and they seem to be perfectly happy with ignoring the change in damming policies of lakes in the watershed. We now dam the lakes up, and for good reason, to make sure that there is water in dry times, not likely to occur in sustained fashion anyway in the Northeast in warm cycles of the AMO. But the fact is, the lakes are never almost parched as they were sometimes in previous years. They are dammed up; it takes much less water to cause them to rise to levels where water has to be released. A 10-inch rainstorm now, is like a 20-inch rainstorm before as far as what can happen on the river. Why, the water is there to be released much quicker, because it was dammed up and preserved. Is this global warming? Yet no one wants to seem to bring this up as a reason for such things, but instead the finger is pointed at the bogeyman that like many, may not exist, or if it does, not be the monster in the closet that people seem to want to portray. What could be the possible reason for hiding facts like this from you? Facts like the idea it's the COLD WATER that may lead to more drought and set the stage for wildfire, or that the change in water conservation methods (in the case of wildfires, even forest management may be in there) that is helping with it. Yes, man may be the cause, but not for the reasons that are being pushed. What happens in a week to 10 days if a hurricane is hitting Florida at the end of the month or early November? Who will say this has happened before, or not as extreme as Kate, later and stronger in '85? No one, but you know what the blame will be, and the conclusions will be almost instant. And that people get upset when deductive reasoning is used as a way to argue the other point of view, should speak volumes as to who is opened-minded in this crucial societal debate, which sadly is political now, and who is not. People will scream, \"Stick to the weather!\" Well, the weather has been invaded by something I never dreamed would intrude upon my peaceful little world: politics. It's funny, in days gone by, complex answers required long, thoughtful process, and debate and very, very hard work. Those days are leaving, and will soon be gone, never to return. Somehow the words of Margaret Mitchell may apply as far as thinking about the kind of hard work that was needed to solve problems: \"Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a Civilization gone with the wind.

According to the article in the National Post, Kyoto was fashioned after treaties for dealing with stratospheric ozone, acid rain and nuclear weapons. \"Kyoto's architects assumed that climate change would be best attacked directly through global emissions controls, treating tonnes of carbon dioxide like stockpiles of nuclear weapons to be reduced via mutually verifiable targets and timetables,\" said Prins and Rayner.

By the way, the Gaia theory states that the earth behaves like a single, super organism. Lovelock says that current global warming is being offset by global dimming, in which aerosol particles from industrial pollution are causing 2-3 degrees of cooling. Keep in mind, this is all assuming that global emissions are stopped suddenly, something that in my opinion is highly unlikely to ever occur, unless the whole world gets nuked, and then it wouldn't really matter would it. Prof Lovelock believes that even the gloomiest predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are underestimating the current severity of climate change because they do not go into the consequences of the current burden pollution in the atmosphere which will last for centuries, according to the article from the Telegraph. Lovelock argues that we have set off a vicious cycle of \"positive feedback\" in the earth system whereby extra heat in the atmosphere, no matter what the source, is amplified, causing yet more warming. There's that that word \"positive feedback\" once again! (from the previous post). Lovelock says that the IPCC's climate models fail to take into account that the earth is a living system where life in the oceans and land takes an active part in regulating the climate. If the models included the whole earth system in their equations they would show the global temperature becoming stable once again after the global temperature suddenly rises 6 celsius after the CO2 in the air exceeds 500 ppm. This contrasts with the current IPCC models that predict that temperature rises and falls smoothly with increasing or decreasing CO2. Professor Lovelock still argues that greenhouse gas emissions should be cut and that deforestation needs to be lessened even though he feels that the changes are inevitable. Do you agree with Lovelock's analysis?

Image courtesy of NASA A moulin is the name for a giant hole in a glacier in which millions of gallons of melt water can cascade through to the rocky surface underneath the glacier during the melt season. Why am I bringing this up now? Well, on a recent trip to Greenland a group of scientists and journalists were alarmed at the size and number of these moulins that they saw on the Greenland ice cap. Some of the moulins in Greenland run on the scale of Niagra Falls and are helping the glaciers to move at three times the rate that they did previously. Scientists say the acceleration of melting and subsequent speeding up of giant glaciers could be catastrophic in terms of sea level rise and make previous predictions published this year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) far too low, according to the article from AlterNet , which is a progressive news website. Professor Robert Correll, chairman of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment said that newly invented ice penetrating radar showed that the melt water was pouring through to the bottom of the glacier creating a melt water lake 500 metres deep causing the glacier \"to float on land. \"These melt water rivers are lubricating the glacier, like applying oil to a surface and causing it to slide into the sea. It is causing a massive acceleration which could be catastrophic.\" Correll stated that one particular glacier puts enough fresh water into the sea in one day to provide drinking water for a city the size of New York for a year. Correll believes that the estimates of a 20 to 60 centimeter sea level rise this century from the IPCC report in February had been \"conservative\" and feels that it would be at the upper end of this range at a minimum. Some scientists fear that number could be 2 metres (200 centimeters), which would obviously have catastrophic effects for European and U.S. coastlines.

I found this story on Space.com. How would this work? Huge satellites would be built in Earth orbit to gather sunlight and convert it to electricity and beam the energy to earth using microwaves, according to Al Globus from Space.com. Read his article for greater details on this idea. Although the U.S. military would reap tremendous benefits from space-based solar power on the battlefield, U.S. Marine Corps Lt. Col. Paul Damphousse said the Pentagon is unlikely to fund development and demonstration of the technology. That role, he said, would be more appropriate for NASA or the Department of Energy, both of which have studied SBSP in the past. Damphousse, however, cautioned that the private sector will not invest in space-based solar power until the United States buys down some of the risk through a technology development and demonstration effort at least on par with what the government spends on nuclear fusion research and perhaps as much as it is spending to construct and operate the international space station, as stated in the Space.com article.

The California Greenhouse Gas Emissions Project (CALGEM), as it is called, was funded by the California Energy Commission. The group determined in 2003 that greenhouse gases produced from burning fossil fuels could be measured regionally, which may help determine how much of the pollution can be blamed on humans according to the article in the San Francisco Chronicle. . How does it work? Twice a day the devices suck in air, which travel down a tube to the ground where CO2 and methane are analyzed. Baseline data collected today will help scientists judge how the level of gases change over time, said Gene Zastrow, vice president and general manager of the Sutro Tower. Inc., which is one of the towers used in the study. According to Zastrow, part of the challenge is to determine how much of the gases are human created and how much are from natural fluctuations. Once they figure that out they can take current estimates of greenhouse gas emissions and use models and monitoring data to determine if those estimates are correct. The scientists would eventually like to have measuring devices employed at up to 10 California sites at a cost of $10 million dollars to set up and $2 million a year to operate.

Now to the post.... The Republican presidential contenders are nearly unanimous in recognizing the threat of global warming and all agree that nuclear power should be greatly expanded, according to an article from the New York Times, which was posted on MSNBC.com. Not all of the contenders are mentioned in the article, but here is a breakdown of what some of the republican candidates would like to do to combat global warming..... Rudi Giuliani and Mitt Romney both agree that independence from foreign oil is important for our national security and want to push for clean coal and other alternative energy methods. Giuliani has also said that ethanol and biodiesel need to be expanded 10 to 20 percent. In addition to the above, Romney supports offshore drilling and drilling in ANWR. Fred Thompson has recently stated that climate change is real and suggests a measured approach. He favors further development of renewable and alternative energy sources. John McCain seems to have talked the most about this subject and believes that there should be a cap on greenhouse gas emissions and that higher fuel economy standards should be set. McCain opposes a carbon tax and favors a cap and trade system, in which corporations are basically rewarded for deep cuts in harmful emissions. McCain also supports the development of a car battery that can travel 150-200 miles without a charge. According to the article, two candidates appealing to religious conservatives, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, call for strong actions to ease the effects of people on the climate, at times casting the effort in spiritual terms just as some evangelical groups have taken up the cause. Ron Paul believes that it it the state's role and not the federal government, to determine CO2 emissions reductions. Duncan Hunter believes that we need to become energy independent and develop more alternative energy sources. Tom Tancredo favors nuclear energy and alternative fuels.

In an article from the Washington Times, Schnare and others believe that geo-engineering can fix the problem much cheaper than efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to Schnare, a geo-engineering method of using aerosols to put small reflective particles into the troposphere would stabilize global temperatures just enough to prevent melting glaciers and thus prevent a rise in ocean levels. Nature has a similar way of cooling the planet with major volcanic eruptions and the ash they send high into the atmosphere. Other scientists fear geo-engineering schemes may do more harm than good and widespread drought is a big concern. Past large volcanic eruptions such as Mount Pinatubo (1991, remember those brilliant red skies in the evening?) caused a substantial global decrease in precipitation over land, a record decrease in runoff and river discharge into the oceans, according to Kevin Trenberth and Aiguo Dai of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.

Update*****David Schnare responds to the Accuweather,com Global Warming Center,,,,,,,,, I'm not an AGW or anything else in particular, although I have a PhD in environmental science and happen to be burdened with a law degree too. I started out as a chemist. In any case, I simply begin with the apparency that temperatures are going up and that if you adopt the assumption that it is caused by GHG, then you also have to accept the fact that the world is not acting quickly enough to reduce GHGs to the degree necessary to reduce global temperatures before melting of the greenland ice sheet (all according to the models and assumptions used by those concerned with GHGs). As for undesirable effects of using particulates in the stratosphere (not the troposphere), Ken Caldeira (Standford) took a very hard look at this and concluded that if the particulates are placed above the arctic (where they would be needed to prevent ice sheet melt), there is no discernable change in local weather patterns elsewhere on the planet and apparently not much change in the arctic. All this does not imply we should do nothing about moving away from carbon based fuels. Just that we don't need to do so in some kind of crisis mode. David Schnare. In the courts..........

Thinner ice takes less energy to melt than thicker ice, so the stage was set for low levels of sea ice this summer.? NSIDC Research Scientist Walt Meier also said that an unusual atmospheric pattern, with persistent high pressures over the central Arctic Ocean and lower pressures over Siberia was another factor in the acceleration of ice melt this season. This pattern of warm winds and clearer than normal skies promoted strong melt. The scientists also noted that the date of lowest sea ice extent continues to be pushed back, resulting in a longer melt season. From 1979 to 2000 the average date of the lowest sea ice extent has been September 12. This year it happened on September 16th. \"As the system warms up, spring melt will tend to come earlier and utumn freezing will begin later,\" said NSIDC Senior Scientist Ted Scambos.

According to the UN, only half of the international disasters two years ago dealt with by Ocha had anything to with climate, while this year all but one of 13 emergency appeals is climate related. Here I go again, while the UN could eventually end up being correct in their viewpoint, I feel that we need more weather data and other evidence to compare over a much longer period to establish a trend in order to prove that many of these individual disasters were indeed directly related to climate change and not just a rare, extreme weather event or an ongoing atmospheric circulation. They may be on to something, but it is just too early in the ballgame to be that certain about it in my opinion. What do you think?

According to the article from the Timesonline, researchers believe a prolonged drought between 90,000 and 135,000 years ago created such stresses on Homo sapiens that the population had crashed. This could help explain why mankind is thought to be descended from a relative handful of people in Africa. \"Tropical Africa was extraordinarily dry about 100,000 years ago. Archaeological evidence shows relatively few signs of human occupation during the mega-drought period,\" said Professor Andrew Cohen , of the University of Arizona. A study of sediment core samples from Lake Malawi, one of the worlds deepest lakes (now 2,316 ft), indicated that the water level dropped by at least 1,986 feet, making it only 410 feet deep during that mega-drought period. During that period, the area around the lake would have turned into a semi-desert, greatly limiting the resources for primates. The scientists believe that the period for the human expansion out of equatorial Africa would have been between 90 and 70 thousand years ago.

That should not be too much of a shocker since warmer air can hold more moisture, but there is more to this story from the China Post. According to the study, which was published in the journal Nature, the amount of moisture in the air near the surface increased 2.2% between 1973 and 2002 and that computer models suggest the only explanation is man-made global warming. Unfortunately, I did not see anything in the article about what happened between 2002 and 2006. \"The humidity change is an important contribution to heat stress in humans as a result of global warming,\" said Nathan Gillett of the University of East Anglia in Britain and co-author of the study. Co-author Katharine Willett from Yale University stated that the humidity during the study period increased over most of the globe, but the western U.S., South Africa and parts of Australia were drier. Gillett ran several computer simulations which would predict what the humidity would be based on three different scenerios. The three scenerios were an atmosphere with no man-made greenhouse gases, one with just man-made greenhouse gases and finally one with a combination of natural conditions and man-made greenhouse gases. There was no match to the actual data with the first two scenerios while the third scenerio (the combination of natural conditions and man-made greenhouse gases) was nearly identical to the year-by-year increase in humidity. Finally, according to Gillett, moisture in the air increases by about 6% with every degree celsius (1.8F) and based on IPCC projections, that would mean a 12-24% increase in humidity by 2100. Yuck!

Anyway, if you have not heard already, the giant Ayles Ice Island in the Canadian Arctic region broke in half a little over a month ago, as indicated by satellite imagery below. The ice island was originally the size of Manhattan as it broke away from the Ayles Ice Shelf in 2005 . All images courtesy of the Canadian Space Agency. This first image shows the location of the Ayles Ice shelf This image shows a closeup of the 2005 fracture location and the track of the ice island through September 2007. These next two images show the ice island just as it is beginning to split (top image) and totally separated (bottom) in a matter of three days during early September 2007. The below image from September 14th shows the two pieces moving south and farther away from each other. The September 16th shot shows the two large ice islands getting closer to Amund Ringnes Island. The September 23rd image shows one piece going into Hassel Sound and the other going into Massey Sound. The latest image from September 30th shows the two large pieces of ice on opposite sides of Amund Ringnes island. One piece of the island has been moving south at nearly 61 miles a week. According to Luke Copland of the University of Ottawa, it is relatively unusual for an ice island to drift so far south so quickly, but he believes this happened this year due to the small extent of sea ice. This recent major split occurred much earlier than scientists expected and Dr. Copland believes it will break up even faster since it has moved farther south into slightly warmer temperatures. \"I'd be surprised if it lasted more than a decade or so,\" said Copland, unlike ice islands which in the past might have lasted in the Arctic ocean for 50 years or more.

Anyway, in a news release from NASA Monday, a group of scientists have determined that unusual winds caused the rapid decline (23% loss) in winter perennial ice over the past two years in the northern hemisphere. This drastic reduction is the primary cause of this summer's fastest-ever sea ice retreat in recorded history which has lead to the smallest extent of total Arctic coverage on record. According to the NASA study, the perennial ice shrunk by an area the size of Texas and California combined between the winter of 2005 and the winter of 2007. What they found was the Arctic Ocean north of Siberia and Alaska was dominated by thinner seasonal ice that melts faster compared to the thicker ice confined to the Arctic Ocean north of Canada. The thinner ice is more easily compressed and responds more quickly to being pushed out of the Arctic by winds. \"Unusual atmospheric conditions set up wind patterns that compressed the sea ice, loaded it into the Transpolar Drift Stream and then sped its flow out of the Arctic,\" said Son Nghiem of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and leader of the study. When that sea ice reached lower latitudes, it rapidly melted in the warmer waters. What about these unusual wind patterns. Well, the article does not go into that too much, but I must believe some of this is due to changes in the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) which are large atmospheric circulations which have major impacts on the weather in certain parts of the world. If you look at the two graphics below, you will notice that both the AO and the NAO have been predominately in the positive phase (red) between 1989-1995 and again from 1999 to current. The positive phase of the (AO) typically leads to milder than normal winters over Scandinavia and Siberia, while colder than normal conditions prevail across Greenland. The positive phase of the NAO again leads to colder conditions over Greenland, while much of the eastern U.S. is warmer than normal in general.

Now keep in mind, we are talking 30 years of data here, not hundreds or thousands. What is El Nino? El Nino is the unusual warming of the surface water in the equatorial eastern and central Pacific, which has been found to have widespread impact on global weather patterns. Currently, we are in a strengthening La Nina phase across this region, which is the opposite of El Nino (cooler than normal surface water over the eastern and central equatorial Pacific). The most commonly accepted indicator of El Nino is the Southern Oscillation Index or SOI, which is an index number determined by using sea level pressure anomalies at Tahiti and Darwin. The research team suspects that the Walker Circulation may play the bigger role, as the circulation tends to weaken during El Nino and strengthen during La Nina. Image courtesy of Wikipedia Dr. Scott Power, a Bureau researcher, said the trade winds were the weakest they have ever been in the 30-year record. Power believes that it is possible that global warming has put the circulation into a permanently weaker state. He cites that since 1977 there have been 7 El Nino events versus 4 La Nina's, including the current one going on. Southeastern Australia is currently in its 11th straight dry year, and some believe that the weaker Walker Circulation is to blame. Power admits that he cannot quantify this link, but he believes that it is part natural and part human induced. Certainly not a convincing study, but I thought it was interesting. Thoughts? UPDATE............ Dr. Scott Power, the lead researcher in this study makes a welcome response to this story in our comment section. Here it is......... Hi Brett, thank you for showing an interest in this work. Just thought i would clarify the situation a little bit. For the SOI we had data extending back to 1876. We examined running 30 year averages - one value for each 30 year block. The lowest value occurred during the most recent 30 year period i.e. in 1977-2006. We also examined the degree to which the difference in the mean before and after 1977 is unusual but shall refer your readers to the paper if they are interested in such technical details. Its a short note so I'd encourage people to read it! We also examined Darwin MSLP separately. As you know Darwin MSLP is sometimes used as an index for ENSO in its own right. Darwin MSLP exhibited its highest 30-year value on record during 1977-2006. This strongly suggests that Walker Circulation weakened to record levels in 1977-2006. To test this hypothesis we examined changes in zonal (east-west) windstress averaged across the Pacific. We used ERA40 and NCEP reanalyses to do this. We recognise that the reanalyses have inaccuracies but they are best available as far as i am aware. This data is also much shorter than SOI. Nevertheless it exhibited its lowest 30 year magnitude (corresponding to weakest trade winds) during - you guessed it - the period 1977-2006. We also used the SOI to define El Nino and La Nina events: if June-Dec SOI>5 we called it a La Nina year, if the June-Dec SOI We then went on to discuss these findings in light of previous work (e.g. Vecchi et al. and other studies discussed in recent IPCC report) pointing out that some climate models exhibit a weakened Walker Circulation in response to global warming. Finally, note that some of the media stories written about the article have different conclusions to the paper itself! Thanks again.

The study also noted an overall rise in the melting trend over the entire Greenland ice sheet. The press release states that the amount of snow that has melted this year over Greenland could cover the surface size of the U.S. more than twice. Marco Tedesco, a research scientist with the Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology, which is managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland used satellite data to compare this year's snow melt with the average snow melt for the period 1988-2006. In addition to the snow melt findings this year, Tedesco was able to determine that melting in high level areas has occurred 25-30 days longer this year than the 19-year average. How about the lower latitude areas of Greenland? The study also confirmed that the melting Index (determined by multiplying how long melting took place by the area where the increased melting took place) this year in the lower altitude areas of Greenland, though not record breaking, was indeed 30% higher than average, placing 2007 in 5th place behind 2005,2002,1998 and 2004 in that order.

How would this controversial idea work? Large vertical pipes would mix nutrient rich waters from hundreds of metres down with the more barren waters at the surface. This process would supposedly lead to algal blooms at the surface, which would consume CO2 through photosynthesis. When the algae dies, some of the carbon sinks to the deeper waters. According to the nature.com article , algae also produces certain chemicals that enhance cloud cover, which also has a cooling effect on the planet in certain circumstances. A similar idea using a wave-driven ocean upwelling system to absorb CO2 is being developed by Atmocean , a company based out of Sante Fe, New Mexico. Each one of their pump-driven systems measures 300 metres long by 3 metres diameter. The company believes that if their system can be deployed across 80% of the world's oceans an additional 2 billion tonnes of carbon can be brought down to the ocean floor per year, potentially doubling the ocean's annual rate of CO2 sequestration. My question is how many of these pumps would be needed? I would think you would need a massive number. Costs of deployment, weather factors and mechanical failure/repair could be big issues to deal with as well in my opinion. Some scientists believe that artificial mixing could release more CO2. Scott Doney, a marine chemist from WHOI said that the higher nutrient deeper waters of the oceans contain a lot of dissolved inorganic carbon and dissolved CO2, and that bringing these waters to the lower pressures of the surface would \"bubble\" out additional CO2 into the atmosphere. Others believe there would be no real effect on the climate from artificial mixing and even wonder if this process could harm sea life.

Dingell, a strong alley of the Detroit automotive industry says that his tax proposals to combat global warming will be painful. \"I'm trying to have everybody understand that this is going to cost and that it's going to have a measure of pain that you're not going to like,\" said Dingell in an interview with the AP.

According to Lowell Stott, lead author of the study, deep-sea temperatures rose 1300 years before the tropical surface ocean and well before the rise in atmospheric CO2, which rules out CO2 as the driver of the ending of the last ice age. The findings suggest the rise in greenhouse gas was likely the result of warming and may have accelerated the meltdown. The researchers studied a unique sediment core from the west Pacific composed of fossilized surface and bottom dwelling organisms. Stott makes it clear that he is not saying that CO2 does not affect climate, but as he said, \"You can no longer argue that CO2 alone caused the end of the ice ages.\" So where did the warming come from? Using water's salinity and temperature to trace the origin of the energy needed for the warming appeared to come from the Antarctic Ocean, in which water was transported northward over 1000 years via deep-sea currents, which is supported by carbon-dating evidence. The researchers also found a correlation between melting Antarctic sea ice and increasing springtime solar radiation over Antarctica suggesting a possible energy source because of sea-ice albedo feedbacks. According to the article from EurekAlert.org, if CO2 caused the warming, one would expect surface temperatures to increase before deep-sea temperatures, since the heat slowly would spread from top to bottom. Instead, carbon-dating showed that the water used by the bottom-dwelling organisms began warming about 1,300 years before the water used by surface-dwelling ones, suggesting that the warming spread bottom-up instead.

Hanson, a lead climate scientist with NASA. Hansen, is best known for his leading role in predicting the potential dangers of man-made induced global warming. The first story from the Washington Times that came out last week talked about a 1971 article in the Washington Post that warns of an impending ice age within 50 years. The article states that a colleague of Dr. Hansen came to this chilling conclusion by resorting in part to a new computer program developed by Dr. Hansen. The article says nothing about what that computer program actually concluded and there is nothing in there that quotes or mentions what Hansen actually believed back then. So, in fairness to Dr. Hansen I refrained from posting anything about this until I saw a response from Dr. Hansen himself, and here it is . The computer program according to Hansen was a 'Mie scattering' code to calculate light scattering by spherical particles, which is more useful for Venus studies and according to Hansen did not make him responsible for a 1971 climate theory. Hansen in his response, though, does not state what his predictions about the future climate were back in 1971. Maybe he doesn't remember. The second story about Hansen just came out a couple of days ago. There were reports that James Hansen received $720,000 from a George Soros program. Soros is a major contributor to many democrats, the environmental movement and women's groups. According to the Investor's Business Daily editorial , Hansen was a \"NASA whistle-blower\" standing up to the U.S. government by being funded by Soros' Open Society Institute (OSI), which gave him \"legal and media advice.\" In Hansen's response he calls this claim \"whacko.\" Hansen states that he did not receive one thin dime from George Soros, but he was offered pro bono legal advice from the Government Accountability Project (GAP) which tries to defend whistle-blowers, and he accepted. He does not rule out that the GAP might have received the funding.

Here are some of the goals and issues that were discussed according to AFP and the latimes.com ......... --European countries called for the world to set a goal of halving global greenhouse-gas pollution by the year 2050. --Developing countries urged rich economies, which are responsible for some 70% of CO2 in the world to honor pledges of curbing greenhous-gas pollution and to help poorer countries cope with the impact of climate change. Developing countries are shy about binding targets since implementation of the promises could brake their rise out of poverty. --The Group of 77, which represents 130 developing countries, including China, feel that rich countries should deepen their reduction commitments in the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol and help poorer countries. A key argument by the Bush Administration for abandoning the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 was that the UN treaty only imposed these limits on developed countries and not on large polluters such as China and India. Secretary of State Condoleezza who represented the United States at the podium said that the U.S. takes this challenge very seriously and will actively participate in future negotiations.

I did a post last week about the differences between the carbon tax and the cap-and-trade system. In his commentary, N. Gregory Mankiw, professor of economics at Harvard University proposes using the revenue from a carbon tax to reduce other taxes. This is on the idea of a Pigovian tax, which was named in honor of early 20th century British Economist Arthur Pigou, whose idea was to use taxes to fix problems rather than merely raising government revenue. Mankiw argues that a carbon tax would provide incentives for people to use less fuel in a multitude of ways, while having more costly efficient cars just encourages more driving, which leads to more carbon output. In my earlier post, in addition to this commentary, it was mentioned that one of the drawbacks to a carbon tax would be that it would hurt the poor and middle class. Gilbert Metcalf, a Tufts University Professor has shown how revenue from a carbon tax could be used to reduce payroll taxes in a way that would leave the distribution of total tax burden approximately unchanged.You can read more about that from the link above.

According to Santer, the atmospheric water vapor content has increased by 0.41 kilograms per square meter since 1988 and the natural variablity in climate just cannot explain this moisture change. \"The most plausible explanation is that it is due to the human-caused increase in greenhouse gases,\" said Santer. \"More water vapor, which is itself, a greenhouse gas, amplifies the warming effect of increased atmospheric levels of CO2. This is also called 'positive feedback'.\" According to the article , basic theory, observations and climate model results all show that the increase in water vapor is roughly 6 to 7.5% per degree celsius warming of the lower atmosphere.

This story made some waves in certain media outlets over the past week. In the book, there is a graph which compares the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere with climate temperature from present back to 650,000 years ago. The SPPI correctly pointed out the error and determined that the actual temperature curve in the chart was mislabeled as the CO2 curve and vice versa. The SPPI seems to believe that the chart was deliberately manipulated by David and co-author Cambria Gordon. The SPPI states that the David-Gordon manipulation is critical because the central premise of the book argues that CO2 drives temperature, yet the ice core data clearly reveal temperature increases generally precede increasing CO2 by several hundred to a few thousand years. I like the line at the end of their statement which ends with............before a single copy reaches any more innocent boys and girls. What do they think is in this book? Dirty pictures, slang? Give me a break! I waited on this story for almost a week hoping to see a response from the authors so I could post both sides to the issue. Laurie David finally responds to the error uncovered by SPPI through the Huffington Post. David states that the illustration (graph) was accidentally mislabled, but that the text accompanying the illustration is accurate. David says that the illustration will be corrected in the next edition. Good thing, we cannot have any more of those young children being traumatized by these mislabeled graphs. What do you think of this whole story? Was the graph purposely altered to fit an agenda or was it a simple mistake that was blown out of proportion.

In the article from the National Geographic Online, lead author of the study Richard Pancost and colleagues studied the chemistry off 55 milion year old sediments from a wetland. From their research, the team concluded that the warm, wet weather during that period likely accelerated the rotting plant material in the bog, which in turn triggered the large methane burbs (emissions). Methane is a key greenhouse gas and assuming these methane burbs were widespread, the increased methane flux could have amplified the warming occurring at that time. Some scientists also feel that a similar process could play a key role in modern warming, according to the article. Currently, methane appears to be seeping out of once frozen bogs in Siberia. Dave Reay, a climate scientist at Edinburgh University, who is not affiliated with the research said, \"The wetland methane feedback effect could be equivalent to wiping out all emissions cuts set out in the Kyoto Protocol (the 1997 greenhouse gas reduction treaty).\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"ada9e5a8e9df1bac4c4932b5f28f035fc581ff8a"}

Unfortunately, as you can tell by the slide show from the website there is a lot of work to be done in order to get many of these reporting stations up to par. The slide shows clear examples of poor siting, which can greatly alter temperature readings. If the siting of an observation station is poor, how can you trust its data output. Obviously, if you just have a very small percentage of poor sites, then it is probably not too much of an issue, but it seems that the problem is bigger than that. As an 18-year meteorologist, I can vouch for the concerns of surfacestations.org as I have seen a lot of obvious bad data coming out of many observing sites over the years. Actually in my opinion, the problem has gotten worse with less human input. I remember two years ago, the local airport here in central Pennsylvania was consistently 2 degrees too warm with its temperature reading for an entire year until they corrected it. You can easily figure these out by noting the elevation and mid-level temperatures and comparing it to other sites. Anyway, now it appears that the dewpoint is clearly reading about 2-3 degrees too high at this same site and it has not been fixed for months. Let me also state, however, there are also many stations out there that show no problems on a consistent basis. According to surfacestations.org, the main reason by officials for not performing up to date surveys on questionable sites is due to costs and meager budgets. What a surprise!

Also, as of September 20th, the Northwest Passage is still open, but is starting to refreeze. The sea ice extent in the northern hemisphere on September 16th, 2007 covered 1.59 million square miles (4.13 million sq/km) for a 5-day average. The old record minimum was set just two years ago during September 20-21, 2005 when there was 460,000 square miles (1.19 million sq/km) more sea ice than there was on September 16th, 2007. That difference in sea ice coverage is equal to the size of California and Texas combined, and you can see that here . The sea ice extent by their definition is the total area of all arctic regions where ice covers at least 15% of the ocean surface. Check out some of the images courtesy of the NSIDC below.....

A different story in Antarctica....... The coverage in sea ice in the southern hemisphere, around Antarctica is nearing a record maximum. Patrick Henry has been diligent in keeping us up to date on this story. If you look at the Southern Hemisphere Sea Ice Area Chart , you can see that the latest data point is just shy of 16 million square kilometers. The record maximum is 16.03 million square kilometers. There is still a chance that this record may be broken. Looking at the recent chart , the sea ice extent last year at this time was varying slightly in coverage area from the end of September to mid-October before the steadier fall took place.

Some environmentalists now believe that by protecting habitat, not just the species, the feds have put themselves in the position to fight any threats to habitat, and that possibly now includes global warming.

A portion of the U.S. temperature data was correctly called into question a while back by Steve McIntyre of Climate Audit, resulting in an adjustment of the U.S. temperature data. The most notable correction resulted in 1934 taking back the top honors as the warmest year in the U.S. on record, no longer 1998. On his website (part 2 of the pdf) , a clearly angry and frustrated Hansen says that due to a \"flood\" of demands for the source code he decided to release it last week, but the simplified version, \"for people interested in science,\" according to Hansen, may not be available for a week or two, meaning most of us will have no idea what to make of the initial release. Hansen also talks about the \"bad\" data out of parts of Africa and South America. He says that if they omit South America and Africa there is only a tiny effect on global temperature change, actually a 0.01 celsius increase. McIntyre fires back , saying that now in addition to South America and Africa, Hansen is also implying that the lack of material change since the 1930s with the U.S. data and lack of Antarctica data does not matter as well. That is indeed a lot of land, especially in the southern hemisphere, and if you are strictly looking at land masses where people live, I would have to agree with McIntyre that it does indeed matter. But, when you combine ocean and land, which Hansen and his collegues do, then it is not nearly as significant globally, based on the maps and graph display included in Hansen's response , since the oceans make up a clear majority of the earth. I am sure many of us look forward to the release of the simplified version. To be continued no doubt.

The research team used the same global circulation models which many current climate scientists are basing their future forecasts on. Take note: the models had to be adjusted to be more coarser due to a lack on knowledge about the geography on the planet 300 million years ago. The models showed that melting large to moderate sized high latitude ice sheets resulted in a reversal of tropical trade winds and big expansions of low latitude desert areas into what had been warm, temperate forests. The team also found that when CO2 was high in the atmosphere, ice sheets were small and vice versa.

The author of the article, Deborah Solomon points out the political battle over climate change is not necessarily a Republican versus Democrat issue, but more of the economists versus the politicians. The article points out that most politicians favor a carbon cap-and-trade system, which would set a limit on carbon dioxide emissions and require companies to obtain permits to release CO2 into the air. On the other hand, you have the economists who tend to favor a tax on carbon emissions. Politicians, even some liberals fear political back lash against new fees (taxes), which is no surprise. The article lists some of the pros and cons of both systems...... Cap-Trade supporters -Better incentive to cut emissions because companies can sell excess permits. Cap-trade critics -It would reward big polluters if it bases its allotment of permits on how much industries emit now. -Spark a lobbying frenzy. (like we don't have that already?) -Caps would probably function much like a tax, levying new costs on business that would be passed to the consumer. Tax supporters -Encourage developing technologies that produce less carbon. Tax critics -Harsh impact on the poor. Solomon notes that most political momentum appears to be behind the cap-and-trade system. Later this month, Senators Lieberman (I-CT) and Warner (R-VA) will unveil a new cap-and-trade bill.

In the article from Scientific American.com , Geochemists Rosemarie Came, John Eiler and colleagues studied the stored rare isotopes of carbon and oxygen in the calcium carbonate shells of fossilized sea creatures. The group was able to determine the temperature for different periods by looking at the number of carbon and oxygen neutron pairings in the ancient shells. The scientists counted the couplings in the fossilized shells from the Silurian (444 to 416 million years ago) and Carboniferous (359 to 299 million years ago) eras and discovered, contrary to earlier findings, that higher CO2 concentrations of the Silurian era were indeed linked to higher tropical ocean temperatures. The team plans to refine the new method and use it to assess temperatures during other periods, such as the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum that occurred around 55 million years ago when there was a sudden shift from a relatively cool to an extremely hot climate.

In the country of China, up to 200 million tons of coal go up in flames each year, which could be equal to America's total CO2 emissions from gasoline. Some experts (though you are not told who) are wondering if controlling mine fires in Asia might be a key to reducing global warming. An economist, Diana Furchtgott-Roth argues that controlling the fires would be more efficient than offsets like planting trees or cleaning the ocean. How do you control the fires?

The link to the DailyTech story is gone already, but you can see the story here from Newsbusters . The survey was performed by a medical researcher named Dr. Klaus-Martin Schulte, who used the same search terms as the original survey done by Naomi Oreskes. The new survey by Schulte supposedly indicated a major shift in the scientific community away from IPCC consensus in regards to man-made global warming. That may be true if we just compare the the two studies. But, there was another similar study done in 2005 by Professor Benny Peiser, who is a climate change skeptic, that seems to have been forgotten, even though it had some errors. For fun, let's compare all three surveys........ Naomi Oreskes study. Oreskes analyzed 928 abstracts from 1993-2003 from the ISI database using the search keywords \"global climate change\". 75% accepted consensus view, either explicitly or implicitly. 25% took no position (neutral) 0% disagreed with consensus Peiser study. Peiser analyzed all abstracts for the same period 1993-2003 and came up with these results...... ~30% accepted consensus view, Peiser's survey was eventually rejected by the editors of Science. Dr, Peiser recently conceded that his study did contain some errors and he no longer doubts that \" an overwhelming majority of climatologists is agreed that the current warming period is mostly due to human impact, but he contends that the majority consensus is far from unanimous. The recent Schulte survey (2004-2007) total 528 papers. 45% accepted consensus view, either explicit or implicit. 48% neutral 6% disagreed or rejected consensus I have no way of confirming whether or not the latest survey results by Schulte show a clear trend away from consensus. Here is why..... --I am sure that when the Oreskes survey came out the AGW skeptics and deniers were disregarding the results, and maybe rightfully so, but now that there is a new study out, they are more than willing to compare the studies, using the Oreskes results as a base and showing the dramatic change in opinion from the scientific field. --If you use Peiser's results as a base, then the trend to the the Schulte study shows an increase in supporters of consensus, but also an increase in those who rejected consensus from 3% to 6%. --What is Dr. Schulte and what is the Journal of Energy and Environment? Not much info I could find. I noticed most of the books that they sell on their web site are skeptical or deny AGW which is interesting. --I would love to see a sampling of these journals. I suspect a number of these journals may briefly touch on the idea of man-made global warming, but I suspect their main focus could be on something else, perhaps pharmacuticals and medicine. --The results of all three studies still suggest that there is still a very small percentage of scientific papers that reject consensus, but there is a growing number that are not totally buying into it and are beginning to question it. --I think there needs to be a better way of finding out this information.

When water flow is greatly slowed or stopped behind the dam, dead fish and vegetation quickly rot, giving off methane, which is a greenhouse gas 25 times stronger than CO2. \"Often its accepted that hydropower is a climate friendly technology, but in fact probably all reservoirs around the world emit greenhouse gases and some of them, especially some of the ones in the tropics, emit very high quantities of greenhouse gases even comparable to, in some cases even much worse than fossil fuels like coal and gas.\" said Patrick McCully, executive director of the International Rivers Network in an article from News.com.au McCully said global estimates blamed dams for about a third of all methane emissions worldwide!

It's simply fallen off a cliff and we're still losing ice.\" Serreze and others now feel that if the increased rate of melting continues, the summertime Arctic could be totally free of ice by 2030, which is much earlier than the estimates of 2070 to 2100 they made a couple of years ago. According to the article from the Guardian Unlimited, the Arctic has now lost about a third of its ice since satellite measurements began 30 years ago. BTW, I did a piece on that story a few weeks ago. Sea ice usually melts in the Arctic summer and freezes again in the winter, but according to Dr. Serreze, that would be difficult this year.

In the experiment, which is previewed here at ScienceDaily , University of Michigan microbial ecologist Donald Zak and colleagues have been pumping extra carbon dioxide into a large plot of mixed tree canopies since 1997 in order to simulate the predicted atmospheric conditions during the latter part of this century. Three different types of trees that are common in northern forests were subject to the experiment and those included were aspen, birch and the sugar maple tree. The researchers found that the CO2 bathed trees grew 45% faster, but in order to sustain this increase in growth rate the trees had to grow more roots and be able to forage more successfully for nitrogen. The team found that the birches were better at foraging than the aspens. The birch trees increased recent nitogen aquisition by 68% versus 19% by the aspens. The study shows that in places such as Michigan, the increase in carbon dioxide in decades to come could alter the abundance of birch and aspen by favoring birch. BTW, speaking of birch trees, I personally love trees and plant them when I can, but I must say the birch tree that I planted in my front yard is the biggest magnet for pests through the summer. You really have to constantly spray these trees to keep them looking decent and healthy. That tree is the first and the last birch I will plant, just too much work.

Ronald Prinn, a researcher from MIT says that natural gas is just part of the solution, and that energy conservation is the first step.

How would this work? Ocean growing plankton would thrive from the fertilization process, giving off more dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which when emitted into the atmosphere, would help spur cloud formation. The increased cloud cover would help reduce some of the solar heating at the surface which would counteract some of the global warming. This idea seems like a big stretch to me in terms of workability, as they would probably need a tremendous amount of fertilizer to cover such a large area in order to produce the necessary amount of DMS. How often would you need to fertilize? How much energy would they need to produce the fertilizer and distribute it across the oceans? Also, how would the fertilizer impact other ocean life?

I cannot believe that the WMO would say something like that in the first place, since there is just not enough proof out there to say that these individual events were caused by global warming, at least not yet in my opinion. What the WMO does say is that extreme events such as hot extremes, heat waves and heavy precipitation events in general will continue to become more frequent under global warming, but I did not find anything in the WMO release that says heat and flood related catastrophes can be thought as a consequence of global warming like the Daily Green article says.

How does this work? According to the EPA , geologic sequestration is the process of injecting CO2 from a source such as a coal-fired electric generating power plant through a well into the deep subsurface. Once underground, the CO2 is sequestered or trapped for a long period of time. One of those funded experiments is currently taking place on an old Texas oil field, where CO2 has been pumped underground over a longer period of time than anywhere on earth. So far, according to the Christian Science Monitor ( through CBS News )the results have been promising, but there are risks. One of the risks is that too much pressure from the storage of CO2 far underground would cause earth tremors and force salty groundwater toward the surface. Current estimates indicate a large storage capacity on earth for this process, which could permanently hold at least two centuries worth of CO2 emissions or 6 billion tons a year.

So far, according to AER, the model has improved operational weather forecasts and as Dr. Ross Hoffman states, \"more accurate simulation of cloudiness means more accurate forecasts of climate change due to carbon dioxide increases.\" Here is the interesting press release from AER.

That is the biggest thing we can do to alter climate change. Dodd: A 50 mpg standard by 2017. A corporate carbon tax (tax the polluters). What about nuclear power? Edwards: No to nuclear power. Yes to wind, solar and biofuels. Nuclear too costly and no safe way to store waste. He is also against liquifying coal, and believes we need clean, renewable fuels. Obama: Explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix. Develop solar. Increase fuel efficiency standards and place a cap on greenhouse gases. Put national interests ahead of special interests. Clinton: Agnostic about nuclear power and feels that we must figure out waste and cost issues first. Have a strategic energy fun that she would fund by taking away the tax break for oil companies.

The wood from the ash tree has been used for decades to create a majority of the nation's baseball bats, including those for Major League Baseball. The main threat to these trees since 2002 has been the Emerald Ash Borer Beetle, which has been accused of killing 25 million ash trees from Michigan to Maryland, according to the article by Monica Davey of the New York Times . In late June, there were signs of the ash borer's arrival in northwestern Pennsylvania, where most of the wood comes from. What does this have to do with global warming? Some, but not all scientists believe that a warmer climate could aid the beetle's invasion by creating stressed trees and a quicker reproductive cycle of the Emerald Ash Borer. A warmer climate would also mean a longer growing season for the tree, making the wood softer, instead of ideally dense and flexible.

According to Lockwood, in the article posted in the Guardian Unlimited , the sun's magnetic field has decreased since 1985, and global temperatures have risen at an accelerating rate. If the sun's magnetic field is high there should be a fall off in cosmic rays, fewer clouds and more warming on earth.

In the article by David Frey from CBS4Denver.com Henson says as the snow levels rise due to global warming over the coming decades the higher elevations of the Colorado resorts will capitalize. The idea is that a large portion of ski areas across the U.S. and other countries are at a lower elevation compared to the Colorado resorts, and that they will suffer due to a greater loss of natural snow, The result will be an increase in business for the Colorado resorts at the expense of the resorts at a lower elevation outside the state. I am not sure if this would work out for Colorado as much as he thinks. What if global warming leads to an even drier climate in the Rockies? I think the true advantage might be the fact that the difference in the length of the ski season from higher Colorado resorts to the majority of the lower resorts would grow, allowing the Colorado resorts to have a higher percentage of their profit coming from being open for a longer period of time.

He will continue as Canadian Weather Expert along with his duties here. I ask you to help me to welcome him to this new role. It's ironic that I started at AccuWeather only about three months after James Hansen's landmark testimony before the House of Representatives on the cause and effect relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and temperatures. Had I been asked in those days about my opinions on global warming, my answer would have been full of skepticism. Today I am far less skeptical, though still not as convinced as the IPCC's authors, that greenhouse gases are forcing global temperatures higher. Land use changes also play a significant role in climate change. As I've mentioned here before, I don't like politics. The politicization of the issue of global warming has made it difficult to have reasoned discussions of the issue. Ideally, people would base their opinions on the science, and not on which politician or political party agrees with which position or, worse yet, on which talking head agrees with which position. An open, questioning mind is useful for scientists and for nonscientists alike. I'd like to thank all of the members of AccuWeather.com's global warming team - especially those who work behind the scenes who have helped me so much over the past 10 months.

His research and recent climate models seem to contradict the idea that that Europe would go into a sudden Ice Age because the release of cold water from melting Arctic ice would shut down the Gulf Stream. In the article from MSNBC , his research states that there will only be a slight weakening of the Gulf Stream over the next several decades, which would have a positive impact on the the temperatures across Europe over the next century. So, instead of warming 5-7 degrees F (3-4 degrees C) from global warming, they would see an increase of 4-5 degrees F (2-3 degrees C), which is a huge difference in terms of long term climate. It appears that the strongest argument in this article is the fact that the Gulf Stream is in very little danger of falling apart or reversing, but a slow weakening is more likely. In terms of how much this would offset global warming in Europe still seems in question and I do not think we will really know this answer until we actually see the weakening trend begin in the North Atlantic. The research also stated that the decline in the ocean's salinity over the past 40 years was not due to the influx of fresh water from glacier runoff, but more due to a change in wind patterns and storm tracks. This could very well be true, but we are only talking a 40 year period, and this might not be the case over the next 100 years or more.

Coral density depends on precipitation at the time of growth, which is largely dependent on the strength of trade winds. When the trade winds are strong, wind shear is strong as well. The results of the study show that several periods of enhanced hurricane frequency, more than four major storms on average per year, have occurred several times over the 270 year period of their reconstruction, with no link between warm sea and air temperatures and the higher hurricane frequency. Researchers point out this data does not predict future hurricane activity. The full study can be found in this week's edition of Nature , a subscription-only site.

Kilimanjaro, Feb. 21, 2000; Image Courtesy NASA Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest point in Africa, has been losing snow and ice cover for more than 100 years. The ice cap was about 12.5 square miles in 1889, based on a rough survey. In 2003 it was just over 1.5 square miles. Some have pointed to this melting as a sign of global warming. A new article in American Scientist suggests this is not the case. Researchers Philip W. Mote and Georg Kaser confirm that glaciers at the mid-latitudes have been shrinking due to atmospheric warming, but they say that the glaciers on Kilimanjaro - located just 3 degrees from the equator - have shrunk for different reasons, probably unrelated to AGW. In fact, most of the shrinkage occurred prior to 1950 and the most probable explanation for the changes have to do with reduced snowfall and increased solar radiation. Past climate reconstructions from nearby Lake Victoria indicate that several decades in the late the 19th century were wet, followed by a sharp decline in precipitation amounts. As precipitation decreased, cloud cover decreased as well. Increased incoming solar radiation sped the process of sublimation (ice changing phase to water vapor). Sublimation can take place in air temperatures well below freezing, but requires about eight times as much energy as melting. These changes in the regional climate shifted the glaciers' mass balance, causing them to shrink. The shape of the summit and of the glaciers also play a role in the changes in the past century. The researchers say that if global warming has played a role in the shrinking of Kilimanjaro's ice, it's only been in the past few decades. It is possible that greenhouse gas accumulations have changed atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns across the region. This article is one I'd recommend to anyone interested in gaining some understanding of how glaciers grow and shrink and what climate factors can play a role in their cycles. It contains a lot of information, but is written in an engaging and nontechnical way that anyone can grasp.

The snow becomes dirty when soot from tailpipes, smokestacks and forest fires gets into the atmosphere and then falls back to the ground. The sooty snow is dirtier and darker than snow without soot, meaning it absorbs more sunlight. Pure white snow is more efficient at reflecting the sun's light and heat energy. The scientists believe that the sooty snow can explain up to 19 percent of total global warming in the last 200 years, and at least one third (and perhaps as much as 94 percent) of warming in the Arctic. The majority of the soot comes from industry and fuel consumption, which means that although this is not greenhouse gas warming, it is still anthropogenic warming.

Tropical trees are better than trees in higher latitudes at capturing carbon while trees at higher latitudes are either carbon neutral or, in some cases, actually contribute to global warming, according to researchers. Different species of trees are more effective at carbon capture than others. Even in tropical areas, tree-planting isn't a long-term solution to global warming. Trees capture carbon as they grow, but once a forest is mature, most of it's carbon-sequestering potential is gone. Even if I were an advocate for action on AGW (I don't advocate any position), I think I would have a hard time supporting carbon offsets.

Honda will continue to make the hybrid version of the Civic, which has had more sales success. Toyota remains the leader in hybrid sales, with the Prius leading the market. The Accord hybrid focused more on producing power than fuel economy, which I believe is the reason for its lack of success. Taking a look at the numbers for 2007 Accords, the basic 4-door, 4-cylinder model, with 166 horsepower and an automatic transmission (comparing apples to apples, as the hybrid comes only in automatic) gets 24 mpg in the city, 34 mpg on the highway. An Accord with a V6 gas engine producing 244 horsepower with an automatic transmission gets 20 mpg in the city, 29 mpg on the highway. And the V6 hybrid, producing a whopping 253 horsepower gets 28 mpg in the city and 35 mpg on the highway. MSRP without extra options: $20,020.00 for the most basic 4-popper, $25,795.00 for the most basic V6, and $31,685.00 for the hybrid without navigation. Now, there's a lot of features available on the hybrid that aren't on those more basic cars, but I think that too is part of the problem here. Who is buying hybrids? People who care about the environment and/or people who are willing to pay more for a vehicle upfront which will save money on gas with improved efficiency. I don't think most people looking at hybrids are in the market for a performance sedan with a lot of extras. The Toyota Prius, with an MSRP of $22,795.00 and mileage of 60 mpg in the city and 51 mpg on the highway is far more appealing to the average person shopping for a hybrid, as is the Honda Civic hybrid.

In this research, conducted by scientists at Virginia Tech, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Georgia, polysaccharides from biomass react with a combination of 13 enzymes not found together in nature and water to yield hydrogen and carbon dioxide. A 12-gallon tank could hold 27 kg of starch, the equivalent of 4 kg of hydrogen. The range would be over 300 miles. This biomass is the same sort of stuff scientists are using to turn into ethanol, but this system is far more efficient, as researcher Y. H. Percival Zhang notes: \"What is more important, the energy conversion efficiency from the sugar-hydrogen-fuel cell system is extremely high--greater than three times higher than a sugar-ethanol-internal combustion engine,\" Zhang said. \"It means that if about 30 percent of transportation fuel can be replaced by ethanol from biomass as the DOE proposed, the same amount of biomass will be sufficient to provide 100 percent of vehicle transportation fuel through this technology.\" Like the method I wrote about earlier this week, this process of producing hydrogen on demand eliminates the difficulties of storing and transporting hydrogen. The costs of the hydrogen produced is within Department of Energy (DOE) goals, and the energy storage density of the starch is higher than DOE goals.

The Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station is a 150 megawatt solar power plant located in California's Mojave Desert. The Kramer Junction plant consists of an array of parabolic mirrors which focus the sun's energy on a narrow tube containing a synthetic oil. The oil is heated, then flows into the power generating station where it heats water to steam which drives a turbine. Kramer Junction is one of several plants in the Mojave Desert which produce a total of 354 megawatts of power. Rich Diver, seen in the photo above, is a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories. Diver has developed a mirror alignment measurement device which should make these parabolic mirror solar collection systems more affordable and efficient. Diver's system, theoretical overly photographic (TOP) technology, is able to quickly and relatively easily evaluate the alignment of mirrors in a parabolic trough power plant and prescribe corrective measures.

Some information on the science of this process is also available at ScienceDaily.com . The process involves heating biomass without oxygen, which produces biochar, a substance with twice as much carbon content than ordinary biomass. This material can then be added to soil. Biochar locks carbon into the soil for hundreds to perhaps thousands of years, making it a very effective carbon sink. It improves the structure and fertility of soils. Capturing the exhaust from the heating process (pyrolysis) can produce energy such as heat, electricity, biofuel or hydrogen. Lehmann says biochar sequestration has the potential to turn bioenergy into a carbon-negative industry. He believes this method of carbon sequestration will become attractive when the value of carbon dioxide emissions reaches $37 a tonne.

The scientists, led by Corinne Le Quere of Germany's Max Planck Institute, blame increasing winds over the ocean surface - which they also tie to human-produced climate change for the reduction in the ocean's ability to sequester carbon. The winds, the scientists say, are increasing due to the depletion in upper-atmosphere ozone over the Southern Ocean, which has produced large temperature changes throughout the atmosphere, and the uneven nature of global warming, which has also resulted in tighter temperature gradients across the region. The winds mix natural carbon which is normally held in deep waters to the surface, which reduces the surface water's capacity to absorb additional carbon. \"This is the first time that we've been able to say that climate change itself is responsible for the saturation of the Southern Ocean sink,\" Le Quere said. \"This is serious.

Add to that the increased pressure from environmentalists for a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and the elements are in place for a boost in fleet fuel efficiency. Yesterday, President Bush announced that he'd ordered his administration to begin the process of raising fuel efficiency standards for new cars (free registration may be required). The President's goal is to reduce projected growth of oil consumption by 20 percent of current forecasts within 10 years. Critics are skeptical that the administration will take action before the end of Mr. Bush's tenure in office. So what will happen AFTER the 2008 presidential elections? Most Democratic candidates have specific goals , some of them quite ambitious. Senator Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson both want average fuel economy to rise from the current rate of near 24 miles per gallon to 50 mpg, although they have different timetables for that goal. Republican candidates are being more sensitive to the needs of struggling U.S. auto manufacturers; Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) has said he would negotiate with automakers on the appropriate increase. Every gallon of gasoline burned adds 20 pounds of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere . The only way to reduce CO 2 emissions from cars and trucks is to improve their fuel economy.

The turbines aren't exactly attractive, but more often, the criticism comes from people who say the turbines kill too many birds.

The subject of this article is a report by the US National Academy of Sciences which found that it takes over 30 wind turbines to create a kill-rate of one bird per year. I believe this is what is called a meta-study; researchers examined the results of 14 studies they considered to be of good quality to reach their conclusions. American wind turbines seem to kill around 40,000 birds per year, while many fewer than are killed by domestic cats. Wait, though - there are some caveats here. After all, your average cat is killing sparrows and other small birds, while wind turbines in California's Altamont pass has killed golden eagles. Image Courtesy US Geological Survey Not too many kitties are killing eagles. Large birds have lower reproduction rates than small birds, so the rate at which they are killed by wind turbines does need to be studied.

Scientists at the University of Queensland have developed a means of recycling brewery waste water which produces clean water and electricity. How does it work? At the heart of the system is a microbial fuel cell in which bacteria consume the the nutrients - sugar, starch and alcohol - from the brewery waste water and release chemical energy which is converted into electricity. The system doesn't produce a lot of electricity - the Foster's project is expected to use 2,500 liters (660 gallons - I double checked the numbers myself) of the roughly 2.5 million liters of waste water the brewery produces daily, and the electricity produced will be about enough for one large household. This fuel cell is 250 times bigger than the prototype that's been running at the university for the past three months. If it works as expected at this scale, the next step is to increase the scale again. Breweries, wineries and food processors can make use of this technology, which is particularly attractive in Australia, where drought has driven up the cost of water. At the end of the process, the water is clean enough to drink. Obviously, this system is not going to power cities filled with people, but if brewers can generate enough electricity to at least reduce their reliance on the grid it should be a win-win - a reduction of expenses for the companies using the system and an ease on the ever-growing demand for electricity.

Insisting suppliers reduce package sizes saves materials, but also saves shelf space. A company the size of Wal-Mart can make demands of its suppliers and get results. The most recent demand? Cut the mercury in CFL bulbs . Each CFL bulb uses a very small amount of mercury, but as the bulbs become more popular, disposing of them safely will become a more important issue. Some environmentalists have made the argument that they actually produce less mercury pollution than incandescent bulbs because coal-fired power plants produce mercury. CFLs do need to be disposed of properly, however, and that requires consumer responsibility. In my own community, collection of mercury-containing items occurs only once a year, and is a drop-off, rather than a pick-up program.

I've written about algal oil here before, once in February and once before that in an entry that's been lost somewhere in cyberspace. That entry was based on oilgae.com , a very thorough site on the production of biodiesel fuel from algal oil. So how does this idea work? According to Greenfuel Technologies Corporation , you take flue gas, or some other gas stream rich in carbon dioxide, and introduce it into a bioreactor, a plastic tank filled with nutrient-rich media and algae. The algae use that carbon dioxide and photosynthesis to grow. Some of the media is withdrawn continuously and the algae is harvested through a drying process. The oil is then extracted from the algae and converted into biodiesel fuel. Ethanol, methane and hydrogen are also potential products from the downstream processing process. To me, this makes more sense than pumping carbon dioxide into geologic formations as most carbon dioxide sequestration plans call for.

Is burning that biomass a good thing, or does it contribute pollution and greenhouse gases to the atmosphere? Burning the waste material does not produce any more pollution than simply letting it decompose, and the ash that is leftover after the material is burned is a 0-17-13 fertilizer with micronutrients such as sulfur and zinc.

Russian astronomer Habibullo Abdusamatov agrees, according to National Geographic News . I've commented on Abdusamatov's ideas on Earth's climate here before. The Earth's climate is complex enough for me, I don't have much time for learning about what is going on in other parts of the solar system. Just the basic fundamentals of what can affect climate, shape of orbit, length of year, angle of axis - all these things that are pretty much basic parts of our understanding of our climate - how many of us can describe any of those things for another planet? I know I cannot. The April 5 issue of Nature featured an article titled Global warming and climate forcing by recent albedo changes on Mars (abstract available free, full article is subscription or pay only). The article described how dust storms on the planet's surface change the albedo , or reflectivity, of the surface. In the 20-year period between the Viking mission in the 1970s and the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission around 2000, imagery shows that many areas of the planet darkened. This darkening reduced the reflectivity and brought the potential for a ~0.65 K rise in temperature over that 20 year period. A Kelvin degree is the same size as a degree Celsius, the scale starts at absolute zero, a hypothetical temperature where all molecular movement stops. That darkening explains most, though not all, of the loss of CO2 ice in the southern polar ice cap. One thing that was very clear from the article is that many Martian climate processes are not well understood. In my opinion, making claims about Earth's climate based on what is going on in other parts of the solar system is treading on thin ice.

The variations in global temperature driven by solar variation tend to be on the order of 0.1-0.3 degrees Celsius, while in the past 100 years, global temperatures have increased by almost 1 degree Celsius. We are currently in a period of high solar activity, which would correspond to some warming. At some point that activity will diminish, though scientists have no way to predict exactly when that will happen or how intense the upcoming minima will be. Will the upcoming minima counterbalance global warming?

We've got to take a look at the carbon cycle to try to understand these things. The carbon cycle is extremely complex, and this will in no way be an exhaustive reference on the subject. Image Courtesy Genomics: GTL; U.S. Dept. of Energy Carbon is the foundational element of all organic substances on Earth, from fossil fuels to family pets. Carbon moves through the Earth's systems in several different ways. In geologic time, weathering and erosion wash carbon-containing compounds into the ocean. Eventually they settle to the bottom where they are eventually drawn into the Earth's mantle through a process called subduction . That carbon is eventually reintroduced into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide during volcanic eruptions. On a shorter time scale, plants use solar energy and the process of photosynthesis to remove carbon dioxide from the air and produce carbohydrates. Plants and animals return that CO 2 to the atmosphere through respiration and also through decomposition. In the ocean, carbon dioxide processed by phytoplankton gets processed into calcium carbonate shells by some organisms. Those shells settle to the bottom of the ocean and form sediment. Carbon dioxide also enters sea water through simple diffusion at the surface, and some of that gets mixed into the deep ocean. Fire consumes biomass material and releases carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has diminished over several billion years of geologic history . Some of that carbon dioxide was locked into fossil fuels and sedimentary rock. All of these things happen without human intervention. So how are we impacting the carbon cycle? When we burn fossil fuels, we're releasing carbon into the atmosphere at a rate of 5.5-6 gigatons of carbon per year (giga=1 billion). In addition, land use changes such as deforestation add about 1.6 GtC per year to the atmosphere. Some of that human-produced carbon is captured by the oceans and other carbon sinks, but the net result is an addition of 3-4 GtC per year added to the atmosphere, which is why a graph of carbon dioxide concentration looks like this: The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"badd41d392fff86c6b7b9159bbdf72d319bcfab9"}

Two electrodes coated with the enzymes are placed in a container of ordinary air with just 3 percent added hydrogen. That 3 percent is significant, because at 4 percent concentration, hydrogen becomes an explosion hazard. Prototypes of the cell produced enough electricity to run small electronic devices. As exciting as this research is, the key to having a hydrogen economy, from a climate change perspective, is to be able to produce hydrogen without using fossil fuels. Nuclear power is certainly an option. Solar is currently far too inefficient to be useful.

That's the goal of new research by Clifford Kubiak, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego. Kubiak's system uses solar power to split carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and oxygen. I'll be honest, my first thought on reading that was, \"But carbon monoxide is poisonous, who wants that?\" Little did I know. Carbon monoxide is a valuable chemical, used in the production of things like detergents and plastics. It can also be converted into liquid fuel. Carbon monoxide is normally produced from natural gas, so, as Kubiak says, \"with CO 2 splitting you can save fuel, produce a useful chemical and reduce a greenhouse gas.\" The biggest hurdle the researchers face is choosing the right semiconductor to produce enough electricity to split the molecules. Traditional silicon semiconductors produced only about half the needed energy. They are now using a gallium-phosphide semiconductor, which absorbs more visible light.

The report will be issued in four volumes, three produced by three working groups, and the fourth a \"synthesis\" report. Working Group I, who released their Summary for Policymakers back in February, assesses the scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change. Working Group II, whose Summary for Policymakers was released today, assesses the vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change, consequences of climate change and options for adapting to it. Working Group III assesses options for limited greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change; their report is due in May. So today's report focuses on the impacts of climate change, who and what is vulnerable to climate change and how we can adapt to climate change. I'd encourage people to at least take a look at the summary - it must be yeoman's work to try to cull 1500+ pages of work into a 23 page summary. I'm hesitant to try to summarize it even further here, but I'll hit a few of the highlights. Warming is already having an impact on agriculture, human health and human activities. Some impacts are positive, some negative. Looking into the future, the negative impacts of warming are expected to outweight the positive impacts, though in the short term there will continue to be some positive impacts from warming. Hardest hit ecologically will be those species with limited options for migration - those in polar regions and in tropical highlands. Coastal wetlands are at risk. In the short term, warming may have some positive impact, as deaths from cold exposure are reduced, but heat waves, water shortages, malnutrition, disease and higher levels of ground level ozone will produce health problems which outweigh the positive impacts. The summary then breaks the world down into regions - Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Europe, Latin America, North America, Polar regions and Small Islands - and that surprised me. Global climate models are not particularly good at making regional forecasts, and the climate is the base upon which all of the impact predictions are made. After a brief look into possible impacts beyond the next century, the report turns to response to climate change. Since Working Group III has responsibility for the topic of reducing greenhouse gases and mitigating climate change, this report sticks to adaptation strategies. Through all of the impacts and adaptation strategies it's clear that some of the hardest hit areas of the world will be the poorest areas.

Some of the comments that have been interesting to me are those about more efficient buildings, from yesterday's Headline: Earth post. A lot of energy is consumed in the construction of buildings, but in most cases, the energy used in the building over it's lifetime - for heating, cooling, running appliances, etc. - far outweigh the energy consumed in construction. The U.N. Environment Programme has issued a new report today on how Buildings Can Play a Key Role in Combating Climate Change . The full report is also available online. This is a very complicated issue, since buildings and their requirements vary sharply between the developed and undeveloped world and between climate zones. The report discusses not only ways to build buildings which will use less energy, through things like improved insulation, sunshades in hot and tropical areas, use of energy efficient appliances and use of energy efficient lighting, but also talks about the use of building materials which require less energy to produce - what they call lower \"embodied\" energy. According to some estimates, nearly three times the amount of greenhouse gases scheduled to be reduced under the Kyoto Protocol could be reduced by the building sector worldwide. The report focuses mostly on new construction, but also touches on savings possible due to refurbishment of current structures. Any remodeling comes with a price, of course, which is often a stumbling block. The report suggests adding efficiency while making other repairs - adding insulation when repairing a roof, for example.

I had a little feeling of deja vu this morning when I opened an article published yesterday at Scientific American.com. This new study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , found similar results. Forests in tropical regions serve as carbon sinks , forests in the mid-latitudes are nearly carbon-neutral, and boreal forests, the zone pictured here in dark green in an image from NASA, actually contribute to global warming. How is that possible? It's mostly due to albedo, that measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. Tropical trees, growing in very wet soil, produce by a process called evotranspiration a layer of clouds which reflect sunlight. That reduction in solar input combined with the carbon storage in the trees has an overall net cooling effect on the globe. Compare that to the boreal region - primarily coniferous trees in an area covered by snow for a significant portion of the year. The soil is dry, so the trees produce little moisture and few clouds via evotranspiration, and the trees absorb more energy than snow-covered land would reflect. The study was done using a model which captured all three of these forest characteristics - carbon storage, reflectivity and evotranspiration. In the framework of the model, researchers were able to see what would happen if the entire globe was deforested. The research has value because it shows where reforestation has the most value in mitigating greenhouse gases and reducing global warming. Trees of course, have importance far beyond their role as carbon sinks. Sustaining forests helps to sustain the world's biodiversity. Making decisions on forestry based solely on global warming isn't good policy for the world.

Gingrich said \"Rewarding entrepreneurship and investing in science and technology -- reshaping the market with incentives -- are the fastest ways to get change.\" He said, \"Regulation and litigation are the least effective methods of getting to solutions.\" Kerry, on the other hand, advocated a cap-and-trade system, where the government-controlled cap would provide structure for business' response. He compared the system he and others propose to the caps on sulfur-dioxide emissions imposed in 1990 which helped combat the problem of acid rain.

Some interesting facts here on how many people in the world get their drinking water from glacial runoff - 1.5 billion - and how quickly the continued retreat of glaciers could result in water shortages, especially in South America, China and India. The glacier Pelley and the 60 Minutes crew visited in Patagonia has retreated 9 miles in the past 100 years. When they visited the top of the glacier, they found it was blackened by earth and volcanic ash. The scientist in me wants to know how long it's been blackened. That's going to play a huge role in the speed of melting, as white ice/snow reflect sunlight, while a black surface absorbs sunlight. It seems to me to be obvious there are factors other than human-induced warming at play in the retreat of this glacier. Although I don't have verification of this, it seems clear that drought is playing some role in the glacier's retreat. Fresh snow would cover that black surface and \"feed\" the glacier, slowing it's retreat.

Jesse wrote about it in the AccuWeather.com Community Blog . Only a trailer for the program is available at the Channel 4 site. The whole thing has popped up here and there - the links appear to be ephemeral, but you can try searching for it on Google Video or YouTube . So what was my opinion? It was interesting. Some of the information presented was familiar to me, some of it was new. Not surprisingly, it prompted quick and resounding condemnation from the other side - and in one case from one of the scientists who appeared in the program. Carl Wunsch, a professor of physical oceanography at MIT, believes the filmmakers mislead him about their goals and used his words out of context. Dr. Wunsch's response to the film is very thoughtful and worth reading. UK publication The Independent documents some of the questionable evidence used in the film. A couple of the climate modelers who run RealClimate didn't pull any punches with their comments. I'd be interested to know the reactions of any of the other scientists featured in the program to the finished product. I don't think all the questions regarding climate change have been answered, but I don't think dueling documentaries are going to answer any of those questions and I don't know that they merit much attention.

This is not the case. The ruling stated that if the EPA doesn't regulate carbon dioxide, it must articulate the reason it is not going to do so. This puts pressure on the EPA, as they can't continue to use the arguments they've used thus far, but it doesn't necessarily force action. The decision is available online , though I have to say I have not managed to get through it all yet, and of course, I am not a lawyer.

Climates most at likely to disappear are those near the poles and in tropical highlands. The tropics and subtropics may develop climates unlike anything seen today. These predictions are important for policy and management strategies, which are currently based on present conditions. Using models that translate carbon dioxide emission levels into climate change, Williams and his colleagues foresee the appearance of novel climate zones on up to 39 percent of the world's land surface area by 2100, if current rates of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions continue. Under the same conditions, the models predict the global disappearance of up to 48 percent of current land climates. Even if emission rates slow due to mitigation strategies, the models predict both climate loss and formation, each on up to 20 percent of world land area.

I'm having a hard time working today. It's beautiful outside my window. Gorgeous, even. The sun is shining, the birds are singing - I want to go for a walk. And I'm going to. As soon as I write my second and final entry here for the day. A journal called Environment and Urbanization will next month publish the first global study to identify populations at risk from rising sea levels and more intense cyclones. The key for being at risk? Living in coastal areas, ten meters or less above sea level. One tenth of the world's population lives within that zone, and populations more and more appear to be migrating to coastal regions. The study gives no time frame for the rising lea levels, but suggests solutions may involve relocating people and building protective engineering structures. It adds nations should consider halting or reducing population growth in coastal areas. This brought to mind a portion of Bjørn Lomborg's House testimony last week - the population of Dade and Broward counties in South Florida is now greater than was the population of all 109 coastal counties from Texas to Virginia in 1930. Florida is now the 4th most populous state in the nation. It's estimated that over 25,000 people move to Florida each month. Other coastal areas are growing rapidly as well. How would the U.S. go about reducing that population growth? People want to live where the quality of life is high. These sea level rise risks aren't an immediate threat, and people aren't going to plan their lives around something that's not even impacting their consciousness. These population growth statistics show that even the very real threat of hurricane losses don't keep people from moving to coastal areas, and from building homes and businesses in high-risk areas.

The process adds hydrogen (generated from a \"carbon-free\" energy source) to biomass during a step called gasification. The hydrogen prevents the formation of carbon dioxide and increases the process's efficiency. The process triples the volume of biofuels created from a quantity of biomass. The process is called H2CAR. Currently, 60-70 percent of carbon atoms in the biomass or coal being converted into liquid fuel are lost as carbon dioxide in the conversion process. Using H2CAR, all of the carbon atoms are converted to fuel. The process eliminates the problem of carbon sequestration from biofuel production. The hydrogen gas needed for the process is generally produced from water via electrolysis - if the electricity used for the process is produced from solar, wind or nuclear power, it is carbon-free. More work needs to be done on producing cheap, carbon-free hydrogen and developing a new type of gasifier for the process. To grow enough biomass for the entire nation's transportation needs using the conventional method for producing biofuels would require a land area 25 percent to 55 percent the size of the United States, compared with about 6 percent to 10 percent for the H2CAR process.

Those on the pro side were global warming skeptics, Richard Lindzen, Michael Crichton and Philip Stott. Speakers against the motion were Gavin Schmidt, Brenda Ekwurzel and Richard C. J. Somerville. It's interesting to read Gavin's thoughts about the debate before and after it occurred. I've read the transcript of the debate, and I'm curious to listen to the podcast when it becomes available. The speakers for the motion \"won\" the debate, votes were tallied before and after the event. I suspect that the result had far more to do with presentation than with content, as I didn't think that the pro side had a strong persuasive edge. Maybe others here will disagree with me. In other debating news, Lord Monckton has thrown down the gauntlet , challenging Al Gore to an internationally televised, head-to-head debate on the subject \"That our effect on climate is not dangerous.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"4985bcb254964318425423c0aa970fe8e2f0656d"}

Recent observations have shown that this decrease in density has begun, confirming a prediction made by NCAR in 1989. Carbon dioxide cools the thermosphere, even though it acts to warm the atmosphere near Earth?s surface (the troposphere). This paradox occurs because the atmosphere thins with height. Near Earth?s surface, carbon dioxide absorbs radiation escaping Earth, but before the gas molecules can radiate the energy to space, frequent collisions with other molecules in the dense lower atmosphere force the carbon dioxide to release energy as heat, thus warming the air. In the much thinner thermosphere, a carbon dioxide molecule absorbs energy when it collides with an oxygen molecule, but there is ample time for it to radiate energy to space before another collision occurs. The result is a cooling effect. As it cools, the thermosphere settles, so that the density at a given height is reduced. The thermosphere is also affected by the 11-year solar activity cycle, with the thermosphere becoming less dense during the active phase and more dense as solar activity wanes. Forecasts of upper-level air density can help agencies such as NASA plan for the fuel needs of satellites, as lower density in the thermosphere means that satellites require less fuel.

The closest reporting station to my house ran 6.8 degrees below normal for the month. And based on the comments I get here, a lot of our resident skeptics live in the north-central and eastern states. So how did February as a whole stack up across the globe? Here's a map of land surface temperatures from NOAA that gives a bit of a global overview: and blended surface temperature anomalies: That's a lot of red. According to NOAA , that global temperature anomaly was +0.60°C, 6th warmest February on record. So how about December-February, known in the northern hemisphere as meteorological winter? Apologies here to my readers in the southern hemisphere. I know it's summer where you are.

Unfortunately, the article seems to take some of the most extreme predictions about global warming and present them as fact. A couple of examples: All of which is changing the way we play and the sports we watch. Evidence is everywhere of a future hurtling toward us faster than scientists forecasted even a few years ago. Searing heat is turning that rite of passage of Texas high school football, the August two-a-day, into a one-at-night, while at the game's highest level the Miami Dolphins, once famous for sweating players into shape, have thrown in the soggy towel and built a climate-controlled practice bubble. Even the baseball bat as we know it is in peril, and final scores and outcomes of plays may be altered too. Is the weather truly the impetus for these changes? Or is it better understanding of human physiology combined with a fear of liability? The death of Minnesota Vikings' offensive tackle Korey Stringer following a preseason practice in the summer of 2001 raised awareness of the real risk of heat stroke. Stringer's death happened in my home town, Mankato, Minnesota after a day with a high temperature of 91 - well shy of record levels. The humidity was sweltering. There was a time when football coaches believed practicing hard in hot, humid weather was good preparation for the football season. That opinion has changed. A warming planet doesn't create hurricanes, but it does make them stronger and last longer. Tropical storms become more powerful over a warmer Gulf, turning a category 4 storm, for example, into a category 5, like Katrina, which transformed the symbol of sports in New Orleans, the Superdome, into an image of epic disaster. No doubt Katrina (a category 3 storm at landfall in Louisiana) did turn the Superdome filled with refugees into a image of epic disaster. For many reasons, not least of which was the slow response of local, state and federal government. However, the basic point - that global warming makes hurricanes more powerful, and made Katrina a category 5 storm rather than a 4 - stated here as fact, is far from proven. Chris Landsea, science and operations director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami has said that the increase in storm strength brought about by global warming is almost too small to be measured . The article touches on the changes in skiing seasons and other winter sports activities throughout the world, which we've talked about on occasion here. Interesting to note that the Iditarod hasn't started in it's traditional location (Wasilla) since 2002 due to lack of snow. The rest of the article discusses green changes which have already occurred in the world of sports, and cheer leads for more changes to be made. All well and good, but truly worthy of a cover of a sports magazine? Sports journalism should stick to sports, not cherry-picking predictions of doom and gloom to try to encourage change.

One thing that I've learned is that no matter what I say, someone is going to get ruffled feathers. I've been accused of political bias by the right and by the left, I've been labeled a skeptic and a proponent of anthropogenic global warming (AGW). These things don't bother me, because the people writing them know nothing about me beyond what they read here. In fact, it tells me I'm doing my job - presenting all sides of the global warming issue. Some people have asked if AccuWeather.com dictates my position on climate change. As you can read in our corporate position statement on global climate change , that is not the case. I wrote yesterday about an article critical of Al Gore in the New York Times. Some readers did not understand the point I was trying to make in my blog entry. My point was simply that none of the criticisms presented in the article were very harsh. Much of the criticism is tempered with praise, especially praise for raising awareness of climate change. I removed a *sigh* from the post because I was concerned people would misinterpret what I was trying to say. Perhaps some people expect that all I'm doing here is reporting the news. Quite honestly, that's not what a blog is. A blog is commentary. It's not always easy trying to provide commentary on what's in the news without displaying a strong opinion on the subject at hand, but that's what I try to do. Sometimes I do it in a straightforward way, sometimes with humor, occasionally even with sarcasm. Occasionally people read opinions into my words that aren't necessarily there. The fact that I refer to Mr. Gore in a respectful way doesn't make me a Democrat - it simply means that I believe it's appropriate to show respect to individuals who have served in our nation's highest offices. I would refer to Mr. Cheney in the same way. I may have overstepped in referring to \"gleeful whispers from the right\" - but I would have made exactly the same type of statement about the left were it appropriate.

I've heard the gleeful whispers from the right, \"Gore's being criticized! In the New York Times!\" As someone who's been closely following global warming as an issue for a while now, I didn't think there was anything particularly new or newsworthy in this article. One of the biggest nits to pick about An Inconvenient Truth is how much it focuses on Katrina, and Katrina's aftermath. Given the fact that Katrina was the weather story at the time the movie was made, it's not surprising that it plays such a large role in the story. Using hurricanes as an indicator of global warming is fraught with peril, as we've discussed here before. We don't have a very large complete data set of past storms to make comparisons, we don't have a very good understanding of hurricane cycles, and there are many factors which influence the frequency and intensity of storms in any given season. 2006's season may have been limited by dust from Africa , along with other factors. Gore advisor and prominent proponent of anthropogenic global warming Dr. James Hansen said of Gore, \"We need to be more careful in describing the hurricane story than he is.\" Al Gore is not a scientist, but he's passionate about global warming. Even scientists have been known to cherry pick data that best supports a position. Is it surprising that Mr. Gore has perhaps overplayed scientific certainty of the causes and effects of global warming? No. Has he done a positive thing by using his political fame to turn global warming into the minds of the American people, and to make it an issue in the 2008 election cycle? I think he has.

Once the manure is processed, it no longer smells. What does this have to do with global warming? We know there are a lot of cows on the Earth, and that no matter what PETA says, the world is unlikely to go vegan any time soon. Those cattle produce more greenhouse gases than the transport sector . Farms have become so heavily populated with cattle that farmers are beginning to have a hard time disposing of the animal waste. Some large livestock operations are now installing expensive manure treatment systems known as anaerobic digesters, and one of the things they do is to capture the methane gas from the manure and use it to generate electricity. The leftover solids can be used for things like potting soil and animal bedding, and now perhaps for fiberboard. The quality of the fiberboard produced seems to match or even beat the quality of wood-based fiberboard. The question is, will consumers be willing to buy a product that's made from animal waste?

Pure platinum is too expensive to use as a catalyst, and its performance degrades quickly through the creation of by-products such as hydroxide ions, which bond with the platinum atoms.

We've talked about Brazilian ethanol here before and some readers have raised questions about damage to the Amazon rain forest - not because rain forest is being cut to grow sugar cane, but because sugar cane is pushing other crops into the rain forest region. Protection of the Amazon has been highlighted this week in the run-up to President Bush's trip. Brazil slowed the loss of the rain forest by 11 percent last year, but if the region's soybean market expands, growers will push into the Amazon region.

Even if the snow doesn't fall, cold weather allows snowmaking. When the cold doesn't come, the ski season gets shortened and the profits go downhill faster than those insane skiers in the Olympics. The key in Aspen ? \"To be in business,\" says Patrick O'Donnell, who was Aspen's CEO and environmental conscience for a decade before retiring in November, \"we rely on putting down 2 feet of good [artificial] snow, good hard snow that we make the last two weeks of October and the first two weeks of November. That way, when March comes, we can still have skiing, we can still get a full rate for our lift tickets.\" Aspen's been on the edge in recent years, making snow within a degree or a degree and a half of being able to. Understandably, they have more than a passing interest in global warming, and a greater sense of urgency than most of us about making the kinds of changes that could slow warming down. Aspen has made some significant changes in their business practices to reduce their emissions, and hope to have an impact on the way others live as well. Much as NASCAR could bring alternative fuels into the forefront for its legion of fans, Aspen hopes to inspire the 55 million skiers in this country (many of them affluent) to drive change by taking political action, supporting advocacy groups and making changes in their own lives to reduce their carbon footprints. Aspen can drive change, but it may well be too late to save that one degree - even if greenhouse gas emissions dropped tremendously today, climate scientists say warming will continue for decades.

The design uses a combination of existing technologies which would add only about $300 to the sticker price of a minivan and would result in savings of $1300 over the lifetime of the vehicle. The minivan, named the Vanguard by the UCS, is not a hybrid. It's a flex-fuel vehicle which also features variable valve timing, a 6-speed \"automatic-manual\" transmission and cylinder deactivation, which shuts down half the cylinders in a large engine when full power is not needed, as well as a host of other features to improve emissions. All of these features are available in some vehicles currently, but no vehicle uses them all. The full technical report is available as a pdf file, and includes specific cost savings and emissions savings statistics. Problems with the Vanguard? Well, the availability of E85 , mostly. Here in Pennsylvania, only 11 stations available to the public sell E85. California currently has only one station open to the public. Production of ethanol from corn will always be limited by the supply of the crop. Competition of use between ethanol production and animal feed will drive prices higher. Research continues on other crop possibilities which could make E85 a more viable alternative for a large number of vehicles.

One statistic I read some time ago stated that if all U.S. corn and soybean production was dedicated to producing biofuels , it would only meet 12% of gasoline demand and 6% of diesel demand, and of course would massively impact food supplies. In the light of that, I read with interest an article in Science (subscription required) titled Carbon-Negative Biofuels from Low-Input High-Diversity Grassland Biomass . The abstract for the article is available without a subscription. This article, out of the University of Minnesota, addresses many of my concerns about biofuels. It documents a 10 year study of a variety of plantings of native grassland perennials which require little in the way of agricultural inputs and which produce a significant energy return. The best returns were found with the highest diversity of plants. The grasses can be grown on land which has been depleted by agriculture. Irrigation is required only as the grasses become established. No cultivation is required, and herbicide treatment is not required. Only phosphorus replacement fertilization would be needed, as legumes provide needed nitrogen. All aboveground biomass is used to produce energy, rather than just the seed. The gross bioenergy yield from LIHD plots was 68.1 Gj ha -1 year -1 . Fossil energy needed for biomass production, harvest and transport to a biofuel production facility was estimated at 4.0 Gj ha -1 year -1 . The article goes on to break down a number of different potential energy production numbers depending on how the biomass is used. Conversion into gasoline and diesel synfuels and electricity via integrated gasification and combined cycle technology with Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon synthesis (IGCC-FT) is estimated to net 28.4 GJ ha -1 . In contrast, net energy gains from corn and soybeans from fertile agricultural soils are 18.8 GJ ha -1 for corn grain ethanol and 14.4 GJ ha -1 for soybean biodiesel. Thus, LIHD biomass converted via IGCC-FT yields 51% more usable energy per hectare from degraded infertile land than does corn grain ethanol from fertile soils. Another benefit of using perennial grasses for biofuel production is a net annual carbon storage in the soil. LIHD plots sequestered 4.4 megagrams of carbon dioxide per hectare per year in soil and roots for the decade of observation. The trend seems to indicate that number would diminish somewhat in a second decade, but would still be much higher than what other crops store. Without accounting for CO 2 storage, 5x10 8 ha of agriculturally abandoned and depleted land might produce about 13% of global transportation fuel and 19% of global electricity consumption. A hectare is 10,000 square meters.

The article highlights conflict between Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Colorado - one of the IPCC assessment's authors, and hurricane expert (and global warming skeptic) Bill Gray , along with several other scientists at the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Just three months ago, the World Meteorological Organization issued a statement on the issue saying, \"no firm conclusion can be made.\" The debate between Gray and Trenberth got personal last October. At the 31st annual Climate Diagnostics and Prediction Workshop in Colorado, the Rocky Mountain News quoted Gray calling Trenberth an opportunist and a Svengali who \"sold his soul to the devil to get research funding.\" Trenberth replied that Gray was no longer a credible scientist and was \"one of the contrarians, some of whom get money to spread lies about global warming.\" I find two things interesting in all of this. First, with the limited complete data set we have of hurricane information (remember, before the age of satellite technology, storms may have gone completely unrecorded), I don't think it is really possible to know whether we're experiencing an increase in storm intensity/frequency due to a natural cycle or if there is some human-induced forcing at work. Second, this \"controversy\" is being drawn from the Summary for Policymakers, and it makes sense to wait and see what the full IPCC 4AR has to say before passing judgment. I found a comment from NOAA's Randy Dole on the Prometheus blog which says in essence that when the full IPCC report comes out and can be compared to the WMO document, the areas of agreement will outweigh the areas of disagreement.

In today's post, he talks more specifically about the information that can be gleaned from an ice core. Question: Specifically related to ice cores, can you explain what information is captured in glacial ice and how you \"read\" it? How can you tell the difference between a cold year and a year with higher than average precipitation, for instance? Dr. Alley's Answer: Temperature, I explained earlier ( Trees and Ice are Links to Past Climate ). Another we use (a \"fuzzy\" one--doesn't reveal short-lived temperature changes a long time ago, but is reliable) is the physical temperature of the ice. If you throw a frozen turkey in the oven, turn on the heat and then leave, and your significant other comes home and wants to know how long the turkey has been in but doesn't have your cell phone number, why, drill a hole in the turkey, measure the temperature, and the colder the inside, the shorter time the turkey has been cooking. The Greenland ice sheet a mile down is colder than the surface is, and is colder than the bedrock two miles down, because the ice is still warming from the cold of the ice age, and we can estimate how cold the ice age was in central Greenland from this. Another is related to the isotopic composition of the water in the ice. If you have a bunch of water molecules, a few of them will have an extra neutron or two (\"heavy water\"). The heavier water is still water, but just a tad heavy. The heavier stuff rains or snows out of a cloud first. As an air mass moves over an ice sheet and cools, the heavy falls out, so the remaining vapor comes closer and closer to being all \"light\", so the next rain or snow becomes more and more \"all light\". The colder the air mass, the lighter the isotopic makeup of the rain or snow. So, the isotopic history in an ice core is a temperature history. If you look at isotopes, and isotopes of gases, and borehole temperatures, you can start to get a reliable history of temperature at the site. In favorable ice cores, we date by counting annual layers (summer snow and winter snow look different, are isotopically different, chemically different, electrically different, etc.). We check as far back as we can using known time markers (find the fallout from historically dated volcanic eruptions, or from atomic-bomb explosions), and it works really well. We have several people count several things several times, try really hard not to \"cheat\" by checking on the answers of others, and then compare our ages to those for correlative climate events in other records (tree rings, etc. from elsewhere). The thickness of an annual layer (after a correction for thinning from compaction under weight of snow above and from ice flow) gives the snow accumulation rate. Changes in \"dirtiness\" of ice (how much dust) either represent changes in the dust delivery, or in the delivery of water to dilute the dust; know the accumulation rate, and you have the dilution. A refrozen-meltwater layer shows it was warm. Fallout of odd nuclides made by cosmic rays in the atmosphere tell how many cosmic rays were getting in (and because the magnetic field and the sun's activity help protect us from cosmic rays, tell about the magnetic field and the sun's activity). One can find micrometeorites, pollen, sea salt, etc. and learn about those. And, the trapped bubbles are our only reliable samples of old air and the greenhouse gases in that old air. So, there is plenty to learn.

To review, Dr. Alley studies paleoclimates from ice cores and is one of the authors of the IPCC's 4th Assessment. I'd like to say thank to you to Dr. Alley for sharing so much information with the blog over the last couple of weeks. Question: Dr. Alley, how can you tell what forcings were involved with past climate changes? Dr. Alley's Answer: One can use strength of magnetization of lava flows and sediments to learn about the strength of the magnetic field, and then the changes in cosmic-ray-produced things not explained by the magnetic field are probably changes in the sun (we don't think the total cosmic ray flux changes much). There are small changes in the sun recorded, and small changes in climate going along, with a behavior that matches what we expect. The large changes in magnetic field that have happened don't seem to have had an effect on climate, so that doesn't seem to be an important forcing. There is little evidence of changes in micrometeorites/space dust (except for the occasional giant meteorite such as the one way back that killed the dinosaurs), so space dust doesn't seem important. Volcanoes block the sun and bring cold--a degree or two for a year or two--this is well-recorded, but isn't \"organized\"--one eruption doesn't trigger another, so the volcanoes mostly make \"noise\". The very skinny version is that climate has been mostly controlled by sun (with small changes in total brightness giving small climate changes), and by greenhouse gases (mostly CO2). In addition, features of Earth's orbit (which move the sunshine around over the planet over tens of thousands of years--more in the north or the south, or more at the equator or the poles) have paced ice ages, in part by affecting CO2. Over long times, drifting continents affect where ocean currents go and other such things, which matter to climate. Question: What degree of confidence do paleoclimatologists have in the climate reconstructions? Does it diminish farther back in time? Dr. Alley's Answer : Given the huge range of indicators, the degree of confidence goes from pound-on-the-table/this-is-almost-surely-right to this-is-more-likely-than-not-to-be-right/can't-say-much-more. In general, confidence is better more recently. Question: Can you compare the current warming in the Arctic with the warming of the 1930s and 1940s? What were the climate forcings that brought on that warming? Dr. Alley's answer: This is still a topic of research, but the recent paper by Johannessen et al., and other work, give good pointers. The most obvious difference between the earlier warming in the Arctic, and the more recent one, is that the earlier one was mostly restricted to the Arctic, and the more-recent one is almost everywhere. The geographic pattern of the earlier one did not look like that expected for greenhouse gases (which had not risen much yet), and the more recent one does look like the greenhouse-gas pattern. Some worker points to a role for sun and volcanoes in the earlier one (occasionally, by accident, brighter sun and fewer volcanoes happen at the same time), together with a \"dynamic\" component--perhaps a change in the ocean overturning linked to the Atlantic Meridional Oscillation. The climate is a complex-enough beast that glib answers should be viewed with caution--the IPCC or National Academy statements on global warming are NOT glib, but are cautious and carefully reasoned, and must be.

The best thing about algae-based biofuel is that it eliminates the competition that exists with land-based crops used for biofuels.

Meeting the demands of producing food and energy on a limited amount of arable land is a great challenge. Using algae eliminates that competition.

Dr. Alley, who studies paleoclimates from ice cores and who is one of the authors of the IPCC's 4th Assessment, has kindly taken time to answer some questions for the blog. Because of length, I will have additional answers in future posts. Question: Dr. Alley, you study ice cores. Other paleoclimatologists study tree rings, coral, fossil records and sediment cores. Are all those sources taken into account when creating a climate record, or would a climate reconstruction be produced from each source? Answer: Yes, and yes. Typically, a researcher or group of researchers will develop a climate record based on one or a few cores. This most typical is a local climate record, giving for example the temperature at the site where the core was collected. (As you might imagine, there are careful analyses that go into such a statement--if you are relating pollen to temperature, then the temperature you infer from the pollen present represents conditions over the region from which the pollen blew to your core; if you are studying indications of temperature in an ice core, then the motion of ice--glaciers flow--may have brought samples from somewhat higher elevation. These sorts of complications are generally handled in the technical literature, scientists love to argue about them, and so we probably do a pretty good job with them.) Once many such records are developed, they are pieced together to reconstruct regional or global temperature. Some selectivity is often used in this. For example, in the studies of the most recent millennium, some workers have restricted themselves to annually resolved records (those in which the age is really known to the year). This is valuable, in that it avoids any problems with estimation of ages (is this wiggle in my core really the same climate event as that wiggle in your core?), but it loses information from cores that, say, have 10-year dating accuracy. So other groups have assembled lower-time-resolution histories from lower-time-resolution archives. This is a little more technical, but.... As you go older, annually resolved records become rarer and rarer, so we use other approaches. For example, in an ice core from Greenland, we obtain indications of the temperature in Greenland, but we also see changes in the dust of the atmosphere. People have carefully looked at the isotopic, chemical, etc. composition of the dust, and it came from Asia (from the high plateaus of central Asia, blowing to the high ice sheet of Greenland). There are HUGE changes in the dust (10-100 fold), and explanations of the dust changes all invoke changes in the source in Asia (you could change how much falls out on the way, for example, but it is hard to find a reasonable model that \"works\" to give the very large Greenland changes). So, we infer that there were changes in the Asian dust source, probably linked to wet/dry (with more dust when the rains stop). So, people go to Asia, and they develop records of wet and dry, and find that the record of wet/dry in Asia looks like the record of dusty/not in Greenland ice, agreeing in size of changes, duration of changes, and in age of changes, within the uncertainties in knowing exact ages. So we then believe we can \"tweak\" the age estimates, within the known uncertainties, to improve the correlation.

That's true. We can't experiment on the climate. There is, after all, only one Earth with only one atmosphere. That's where climate models come in. Models are very complex numerical representations of the climate. The more complex the model, the more computing power is needed to run it. They create, in effect, virtual Earths that modellers can experiment with. Since climate modelling is so central to climate prediction, it only makes sense to stop and take a look at what climate models are and how they are developed and tested. The UK Met Office's Hadley Centre provides an overview of different types of climate models, from simple to complex. Gavin Schmidt of NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies has written an excellent, readable overview of the physics of climate modelling which briefly covers the history and development of climate models and explains the difference between weather forecasting models and climate models. Weather is chaotic, climate is stable. Climate models are tested primarily with the present, particularly from 1979 on, when satellite data became readily available. Climate models, like weather forecasting models, seem to work best when taken as ensembles - the average seems better than any one whole - ironically, this is often the case with humans as weather forecasters as well. Weather forecasting models have improved markedly in my 20 years as a meteorologist. I'm sure climate models have also had significant improvements in the last 20 years and will continue to improve in the future.

Question: Dr. Alley, is any one climate proxy more accurate than the others? Does any provide more information than the others? Dr. Alley's Answer: Consider the width of a tree ring. It records how \"happy\" a tree is by how much the tree grew. Go to a very dry place, and a \"happy\" tree is one getting rain, so the tree rings are rain gauges. Go to a very cold place, and a happy tree is a warm one, so the tree rings are thermometers. But, the tree will also notice if it is being eaten by beetles, or shaded by neighbors, or other things. So the history of thickness of tree rings from one tree is unlikely to be a very good climate record. But, use a lot of trees, and you start to average over the changes in beetles and neighboring trees, and to see the climate signal. With enough trees, and enough cleverness, you start to learn about temperature and rainfall, over large areas. Consider the isotopic composition of nitrogen and argon in ice-core bubbles. When snow falls on an ice sheet, the weight of the new snow squeezes the old snow until bubbles are pinched off, trapping air samples. Usually, the snow gets a couple of hundred feet deep, so the bubbles are being trapped way down there. The spaces in the snow are interconnected from the surface down to a couple of hundred feet, but the spaces are small enough that the wind doesn't mix the air, which instead mixes by diffusive processes. If you warm or cool the surface, it takes a century or so for the temperature to change down where the bubbles are trapped (it takes a short while to burn the thin skin on your finger if you touch a hot burner, much longer to cook a hamburger, and much much much longer to cook a turkey; roughly, make something twice as big and heating it takes four times as long, so the couple of hundred feet to the bubble-trapping depth does take a century or so). During that century, the temperature at the top and bottom of the snow will be different. When communicating gases not mixed by the wind have a temperature difference imposed, the gases separate (by a TINY amount) with the heavier ones on the cold end, in a process known as thermal diffusion, which is very well understood by physicists. This makes the trapped gases slightly different from the free atmosphere. If one measures characteristics (such as the isotopic composition of nitrogen and argon) that cannot change rapidly in the atmosphere (because there is so much nitrogen and argon up there, and such small gains and losses), then you can learn the deviations, and thus the temperature differences across the snow, and thus the history of temperature change at the surface. This is almost entirely a history of temperature change in the near-surface (there is a \"tweak\" because the gases also separate a tiny bit under gravity, and the thickness of the snow hence the gravitational effect may change a bit, but by measuring argon and nitrogen isotopes, the temperature and gravity effects can be separated because they affect nitrogen and argon differently. Then, because the gravity depends on the snow thickness which depends on temperature and snowfall rate, you can learn something about snowfall, too.). This is a much easier thermometer than a tree ring, because the gases don't worry about neighboring trees or beetles (which are notably absent on the ice sheets). But, we don't happen to have an ice sheet in Kansas, so we have to use tree rings or something else there rather than ice-core gases. In short, nature gives us lots of indicators, the indicators are not as easy as going out and reading a thermometer, but we can read the indicators with a bit of effort and care.

According to the Reuters article as picked up by CNN, \"The group includes General Electric, Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor North America, investment bank Goldman Sachs, and Wal-Mart among its major corporations.\" The article helpfully points out that \"President George W. Bush's administration has rejected mandatory caps on emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases in the United States that contribute to a documented rise in world temperatures -- which is linked to more severe storms, worse droughts, rising seas and other ills.\" It will be interesting to see how long the Bush administration will continue to hold out on the issue of emissions caps when one of its key pillars of support--corporate America--is increasingly more vocal about global warming. After all, it's hard to say no to GE and Wal-Mart. Not to be outdone, yesterday the European Union also called for emissions cuts , as related in an article in this morning's The New York Times (free registration may be required to read the article). The EU's ministers \"pledged Tuesday to raise their own targets if industrialized countries like the United States made similar efforts.\" (The Bush administration must be feeling pretty friendless these days, although I suspect they're more concerned about the stance of corporate America than they are about that of the minister of Finland.) All is not harmonious amongst the members of the EU, however. A proposal that \"20 percent of all energy must come from renewable sources, like wind and solar power, by 2020\" was not approved because of resistance from Poland and Hungary, who are concerned that the poorer European countries will further fall behind as they attempt to develop their economies. Sweden and Denmark, on the other hand, are pushing for a 30 percent target, and the German Parliament has recommended a 40 percent target. Concludes the article, \"Such differences could foreshadow a showdown in March, when political leaders are to meet in Brussels and reach a final position.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"2006dd6abf03c36f99ed534f01a0320189126562"}

I had a lot of questions - how do we get the hydrogen we need? How do we store it? And how exactly does it work as an energy source. It's not a fuel - but rather a \"carrier\" of energy. When you have questions like this, who should you turn to? Oh, I know! Popular Mechanics! What a great magazine. It's a little like an old store in State College, O.W. Houts, where you can buy everything you could ever need from hardware to china to potato salad. Popular Mechanics will teach you how to fix your car, tell you about the latest scientific breakthroughs and help you choose the right outdoor equipment for you. In November, Popular Mechanics featured a very informative article called The Truth About Hydrogen which answered many of the questions regarding the challenges facing practical employment of hydrogen power. The article breaks down those challenges under the categories of production, storage, distribution and use. It's clear that each of these is a major hurdle which will need to be overcome in order have a true hydrogen economy, especially if we want a clean hydrogen economy. Right now, most hydrogen produced for industrial use is produced from natural gas in a process which produces, among other things, carbon dioxide. Storage and distribution are also currently energy intensive tasks. The price tag on a hydrogen economy will be huge. The vision of our world thriving on a hydrogen economy is a beautiful one, but the road to that place will be rough and steep.

I'm sure some of you are subscribers to Nature, but others are not. Nature is available online at many libraries as well. I'll try to give a run-down of what the journal has to say on the subject over the next few days. We're learning a lot about climate change, but that doesn't change the fact that most if it is fairly new science and there are a load of complexities we're just starting to understand. Some of these are addressed in Nature 's article Climate change 2007: What we don't know about climate change . The article touches briefly on regional climate prediction. The 4AR for the first time makes some predictions of regional climate, but this is still very primitive stuff. Regional climate forecasts have more value for people than global forecasts, so improvements in these areas are important, right now, this science is in its infancy. Another critical area researchers know little about at this time is the feedback effects which may enhance or weaken the speed and intensity of climate change. I've touched on feedbacks in the past. Positive feedbacks - those things which could speed up and intensify climate change - are some of the scariest possibilities out there. What happens if the methane hydrates locked in the Arctic tundra melt and are rapidly released in to the atmosphere? What happens if the oceans - currently carbon sinks - become carbon neutral or worse yet carbon sources? Negative feedbacks - things which could slow down and/or weaken global warming - are also possibilities. Scientists are still unsure about how much sea level rise will occur in the next century, as I noted during the week prior to the release of the IPCC Summary for Policymakers. Another uncertainty noted in Nature has to do with extreme weather. Climate researchers believe stronger storms and heavy rainfall will become more frequent, but pinning down where and when that may happen hasn't happened yet. The uncertainty is particularly great in the mid-latitudes, where some models predict more storms and others do not. How do researchers get more information? Through better data - closing the gaps and eliminating the errors in what is being collected now. That's the first and most important point. Improvements in the models will come as more computing power becomes available and our understanding of climate systems improves.

The first, Carbon copies , addressed the likelihood that some sort of cap and trade system will be implemented in the U.S. within the next 10 years, quite possibly by 2010. The system will probably look much like the system currently in place in the European Union, where 362 tonnes of carbon were traded in 2005. Cap and trade, you probably remember, is the system in which carbon emitters are \"capped\" at a certain amount of emissions and if they are over that cap, they must buy credits from an emitter who is under their cap. Cap and trade has limitations - it could work for industry and power generators, but not for transportation in any simple way. One of the main points of the Nature article is that the carbon market should be compatible with the European market rather than reinventing something that is already working in another part of the world. The second article, Is the global carbon market working? discusses whether the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), a global market for emissions reductions established in 2003 by the Kyoto Protocol, is working to effectively reduce carbon emissions. Here's an excerpt from the article explaining how the CDM works: The CDM works by paying developing countries to adopt lower-polluting technologies than they otherwise would. For example, rather than building an inefficient but cheap coal-fired power plant, a Chinese utility might choose instead to build a more efficient gas-fired plant that emits less carbon dioxide. The difference in potential carbon emissions between the coal and gas plants can, after monitoring and certification, be converted into CDM credits that can be sold to an industrialized nation party to the Kyoto Protocol. The revenue from the credits enables the utility to afford the more expensive gas plant. The purchase of low-cost credits by industrialized nations to offset their own emissions reduces the cost of complying with Kyoto. The mechanism works because it is cheaper to construct low-carbon energy infrastructure from scratch in developing nations than to modify or replace existing technology in industrialized nations. Sounds great, but is it working? The system has some serious problems. The CDM covers all six Kyoto Protocol gases (CO 2 , methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride), and although even China and India have embraced the system, the incentives for building low-carbon energy infrastructure haven't been effective. Instead, almost 30% of the CDM credits currently come from capturing and destroying trifluoromethane (HFC-23), a by-product of the manufacture of refrigerant gases. HFC-23 is easy and cheap to capture and destroy - industrialized nations do so voluntarily. It would be considerably cheaper for industrialized nations to pay for the installation of the technology to capture and destroy the HFC-23 and eliminate that from the list of possibilities for the trading scheme. A simple solution offered in the article is to simply make the global carbon market a market for CO 2 rather than for all six Kyoto Protocol gases. Use the developing world's participation in the CDM to put those nations on \"a path to a low-carbon future\" through the development of lower carbon energy sources. Address the other Kyoto Protocol gases in other agreements. That solution is simple, but unlikely to occur: What matters in the long term is the type of energy infrastructure that gets locked into place in the world economy. Tackling that problem requires identifying economic, national security, as well as energy priorities of the major developing economies and then finding ways to align them with low-carbon energy infrastructures. The CDM, no matter what the price of carbon, is unlikely to convince China that it makes more sense to depend on foreign sources of natural gas than on cheaper domestic coal. Similarly, India is unlikely to pursue nuclear energy to significantly reduce its carbon emissions, given the challenges of non-proliferation and nuclear waste, without greater international support. Additional measures will be required in the future to get all nations involved in cutting carbon emissions.

Svensmark, a researcher at the Danish National Space Center, believes that a relative minimum of cosmic rays are leading to a reduction in cloud cover. Clouds help cool the planet by reflecting some of the incoming solar radiation. Svensmark's research shows that cosmic rays produce electrically charged particles in the atmosphere which attract water molecules and eventually lead to the formation of clouds. More information about the research can be found at the SKY experiment 's homepage. Even though Svensmark believes these cloud changes are having a significant effect on the climate, it's important to note he does not deny that humans are having an impact on the climate. He claims carbon dioxide emissions due to human activity are having a smaller impact on climate change than scientists think. If he is correct, it could mean that mankind has more time to reduce our effect on the climate. Some cloud specialists disagree with Svensmark's findings. I think it is worth further investigation.

New, smart meters have been developed which provide a sort of \"energy Internet,\" providing data on what is happening throughout the grid in real time. The meters can also receive real-time data on grid conditions, load and pricing. Pacific Gas & Electric will have supplied its 9.3 million customers in central and northern California with smart meters by 2011. The smart meters are a stepping stone to a smart grid which would be more distributed rather than centralized, as our current grid is. A centralized grid is tremendously inefficient. Small turbines can convert energy with 70-85% efficiency, while in a centralized grid, only one third of the fuel energy burnt in power plants ends up as electricity. Denmark began a push towards decentralized power 20 years ago, and has seen its carbon dioxide emissions drop from 937 grams per kilowatt hour in 1990 to 517 grams per kilowatt hour in 2005. Since much of the smart-grid technology was not available when Denmark made the switch, they relied on tough regulations to force the change. Utility companies don't have a natural incentive to make the changes toward decentralization, as often it is the consumer who benefits the most, with utility companies seeing lower sales. Changes in electricity storage systems, made more economically feasible with smart grids, can help ease capacity demands. Real-time pricing may also encourage people to reduce their energy consumption. Imagine being able to adjust your thermostat to a higher temperature in the summer if the price of electricity crossed a preset threshold. Obviously, all of this includes a lot of infrastructure, which is costly. But we Americans know our power grid is old and barely keeping up with demands, especially in the summer. As we upgrade it, it only makes sense to invest in technologies which are cost effective.

Nonetheless, I was a little surprised to see that California Assemblyman Lloyd Levine plans to introduce a bill to ban incandescent light bulbs by 2012. I understand that the technology behind incandescents is almost 125 years old and they are tremendously inefficient - with only about 5 percent of the energy they receive being converted to light. Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) use at least 2/3 less energy and last much longer. They also produce up to 70 percent less heat than an incandescent lamp. As I said earlier this week, I LOVE efficiency, but this..... Assemblyman Lloyd Levine plans to introduce the bill this week, saying the spiral light sources are so efficient that consumers should be forced to use them. I have to say that makes me a little uncomfortable. It's just the use of the word \"forced,\" I guess. I suppose that's how some motorcyclists feel about helmet laws - which I'm in favor of, by the way. One of my first entries on this blog was about CFLs . I've been replacing most of the incandescents in my own home with CFLs as they've been burning out, and I've generally been very happy with the results. The only - minor - irritation is the extra beat it takes after flipping the switch for the lamp to light. I do have some fixtures that CFLs just would not look right in, and I wouldn't be happy to have my choice legislated away from me. CFLs do contain mercury and need to be recycled accordingly. I read a piece on environmental blog treehugger.com which argues that CFLs actually reduce mercury pollution because most of our electricity is produced using fossil fuels, especially coal, which gives off mercury during its combustion.

Dr. Pielke's conclusions summarize his findings about climate science, and particularly the impact humans have had on the climate. Humans are significantly altering the global climate, but in a variety of diverse ways beyond the radiative effect of carbon dioxide. The IPCC assessments have been too conservative in recognizing the importance of these human climate forcings as they alter regional and global climate. These assessments have also not communicated the inability of the models to accurately forecast the spread of possibilities of future climate.

It's from the January 30 issue of EOS, which is the weekly newspaper of the American Geophysical Union. I would link the article, but I'm not a subscriber. Elliot faxed me the hard copy of the article, titled A Perspective on Global Warming, Dimming and Brightening . Global dimming is the reduction of solar radiation measured at the Earth's surface, which has been observed since the beginning of systematic measurements in the 1950s. That trend may have reversed over the past decade or so. It's believed that global dimming is probably due to an increase in aerosol particles in the atmosphere, but aerosols' impact on global temperatures continue to be poorly understood. The reduction in solar (shortwave) radiation from 1958 to 1992 was 20 watts per square meter, far more than the 2.4 w/m 2 increase in the positive longwave forcing believed to have occurred due to increases in greenhouse gases since the dawn of the industrial age. The EOS article, written by Gerald Stanhill , raises questions about the IPCC, which has never, at least through the Third Assessment Report, made reference to changes in solar radiation at the Earth's surface. Considering that solar radiation is the primary driver of climate, Dr. Stanhill questions \"the confidence that can be placed in a top-down, 'consensus' science system that ignores such a major and significant element of climate change.\" The views expressed are those of the author and not necessarily those of AccuWeather, Inc. or AccuWeather.com"],"_cached_page_id":"d702d5da64226cc6c3a01a0e26056bb0536a92df"}

So if you have 3 and a half hours to kill and C-Span is your thing, I would point you to yesterday's House Oversight and Government Committee Hearing on Climate Change Research (see the link under \"Recent Programs\".) This hearing featured testimony from Dr. Drew Shindell of NASA GISS, Dr. Roger Pielke, Jr. of the University of Colorado, Dr. Francesca Grifo, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists and Mr. Rick Piltz of the Government Accountability Project and former senior associate, U.S. Climate Change Science Program on allegations of political interference with the work of government climate change scientists. If you want to skip the political verbiage, testimony begins at about the 1 hour, 12 minute mark in the video. Additional resources can be found on the House Oversight site, including full witness testimony , which was not presented verbally before the committee. Dr. Pielke comments on his testimony and also on his overall impressions of the heaving at Prometheus, the science policy blog . Dr. Grifo and Mr. Piltz testified on an investigative report by UCS and GAP on suppression of federal climate research . Respondents to the UCS survey had experiences ranging from control of content of interviews with media outlets or outright denial of access of the media to the scientists to edits in review of their work which changed the meaning of their scientific findings. Controlling media contacts is understandable and somewhat acceptable - after all, we don't want every employee of the State Department going to the media with their own personal opinions on the Middle East. Many of the issues of editing were touched on in the UCS report on ExxonMobil's \"disinformation campaign\" - particularly those involving Philip Cooney, former Chief of Staff for the White House Council of Environmental Quality. Changing the meaning of scientific findings for any reason is completely unacceptable. Listening to the comments by the various house members on the committee, in most cases it was easy to tell which party each member belonged to simply by their remarks.

The summary is not very heavy in the actual science, being written for nonscientists. I'd recommend people with an interest in the subject of global warming and in the debate over global warming policy take the time to read the summary. If 21 pages seems too overwhelming, I'd especially point to pages 10-13, the Projections of Future Changes in Climate and to the figures on pages 15 and following. For those who will only read a few pages of the report, I'd like to summarize some of the abbreviations used in the report used in the report. TAR is the Third Assessment Report, the IPCC's 2001 report on climate change. AR4 is the 4th Assessment Report. SRES is the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios. The summary uses terms to describe mathematical probabilities, with Virtually certain > than 99% probability of occurrence, Extremely likely >95%, Very likely >90%, Likely >66%, More likely than not >50%, Unlikely The summary includes references (in the squiggly brackets) to the chapters in the full report where each point is supported. I wish I had access to the whole thing, but at this point I don't. As has been widely reported, the conclusions of the summary are that warming is happening, and humans are \"very likely\" to blame for it. It's hard for me to assess the evidence without access to the full report - like everyone else, I have to take the summary at its word. I know that many of the regular readers here are cynical to say the least about anything that comes out of the U.N. I choose to believe these scientists have no ulterior motives. It is clear from reading the summary that, if these scientists are correct, warming will be with us for a long time, no matter what we do about our emissions. Thinking about ways to adapt to our changing climate may be equal in importance to coming up with ways of cutting emissions.

The new assessment predicts a sea level rise this century of less than 50 cm, as compared to a prediction of 9-88 cm in the 2001 assessment. I had a chuckle at this quote: The European Union and many environmental groups want the world to cap any rise in temperatures at 2 degrees C (3.6 F) over pre-industrial levels, saying such a rise would cause dangerous changes to nature such as more heat waves. Cap temperature rise? As humans, we can cap our emissions, but that's about the best we can do. Temperatures will do as they will. Reuters also published an article previewing the IPCC report by using some estimates of global implications of temperature rise based on Britain's Stern Report, published back in October. The thing that struck me from the numbers was the amount of uncertainty. A 3 degree temperature rise would subject 1-4 billion \"more\" people to water shortages. That's quite a large range.

I have to say when I first read the Newsweek headline 7 Ways to Save the World , I rolled my eyes a little bit - I just dislike headlines like that. But the article? The article is great. All about efficiency. Love it. I read an article on efficiency in a special edition of Scientific American back in September which started off by explaining that conversion from energy source to final energy (what you consume), two thirds of the energy is lost. If we can increase efficiency, we can save energy (and money) without significant adjustments in our lifestyles. So what sorts of changes can we make to increase efficiency? Add insulation to our homes, including potentially replacing old, leaky windows. Change over to compact fluorescent bulbs - much of the energy used to light incandescents is wasted as heat, an unwanted byproduct in the summer months, replace heating and cooling technologies with heat pumps, increase efficiencies in factories - and some of the examples in the article are truly impressive, German chemical giant BASF using heat produced in one factory to power the next in an interlocking complex of more than 200 chemical factories, drive green - can't afford a hybrid? Consider a diesel. Buy more energy efficient appliances and last of all, juggle payment - although this seems like an option for corporations than for individuals, except in California, where utilities are paying customers for cutting power use by 10 percent or more. Okay, so what's the bottom line? Why wouldn't we choose to be more efficient and save money in the long run? Quite simply, it's the upfront costs. New windows? OUCH. Even adding $1000 in insulation can be pretty daunting. Many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and simply can't afford to pay extra for a hybrid or a diesel car or truck. Energy Star appliances can be much more in initial cost than basic appliances, and it's hard for many of us to justify that front-end cost. We have a washer and dryer that are 12 years old and tremendously inefficient. We want to replace them, but it always seems that something else demands the dollars.

The Pew Center on Global Climate Change offers some definitions. Global Warming The progressive gradual rise of the Earth's average surface temperature thought to be caused in part by increased concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere. Climate Change Refers to changes in long-term trends in the average climate, such as changes in average temperatures. In IPCC usage, climate change refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. In UNFCCC usage, climate change refers to a change in climate that is attributable directly or indirectly to human activity that alters atmospheric composition. Just by way of clarification, IPCC is the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the UNFCCC is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change . Interesting that two United Nations organizations have two different definitions for the same term. WCCO TV in Minneapolis has a brief piece on their site discussing the difference, but I believe they only mention the true reason behind the president's choice of words in passing. Global warming is a political lightning rod. It carries extra baggage with it. The baggage of human responsibility. Climate change seems to leave the door open for it not to be our fault. Whether or not warming is caused by man, it makes it far more difficult to discuss the matter when the same words and phrases are defined differently by different groups.

Not surprisingly, students are rallying around global warming as an issue the same way they rallied around civil rights, Vietnam, and ecological issues in the '70s. And they're making a difference. The College of the Atlantic in Maine is now carbon neutral. Middlebury College in Vermont has plans to be carbon neutral by 2012. I was a little surprised to see that the University of Oklahoma buys 100 percent wind energy - surprised because such actions seem to be occurring at small, private schools rather than at state universities. I have mixed feelings about this story. It's great that students continue to step up and be active and be involved. Much better than spending their free time in college partying without a thought to what's in the future. On the other side of the coin, I'm reminded of a Penn and Teller piece I saw a few months ago. It was from the series they had on Showtime. In the episode, a producer went to a rally for an ecological cause with a petition to ban \"dihydrogen monoxide.\" Yep. Good ol' H2O.

I try to watch it every year, and this year was no exception. Of course, I had another motivation beyond simply getting a feel for what the President wants to accomplish this year - I had heard that Mr. Bush was going to discuss energy policy and climate change . And so he did. As is always the case with the State of the Union, the President's remarks on each subject were fairly brief. As such, I will simply include what he said on energy here. Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps America's economy running and America's environment clean. For too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil. And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes, and to terrorists -- who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments, raise the price of oil and do great harm to our economy. It is in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply -- and the way forward is through technology. We must continue changing the way America generates electric power -- by even greater use of clean coal technology ... solar and wind energy ... and clean, safe nuclear power. We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles, and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel. We must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol -- using everything from wood chips, to grasses, to agricultural wastes. We have made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies in Washington and the strong response of the market. Now even more dramatic advances are within reach. Tonight, I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal. Let us build on the work we have done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next ten years -- thereby cutting our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import from the Middle East. To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017 -- this is nearly five times the current target. At the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks -- and conserve up to eight and a half billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017. Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but will not eliminate it. So as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must also step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways. And to further protect America against severe disruptions to our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil. These technologies will help us become better stewards of the environment -- and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change. I'm sure this is far less action, and less acknowledgment of the issue of climate change than many would like - especially with the press for increased domestic oil production - but at least it signals a move toward more energy independence, which in my opinion is a good thing. Just an off-topic note to wrap up this morning - I know many of you are probably wondering why your comments from this weekend haven't been published. I helped out in forecasting Monday and had to travel to State College yesterday for some meetings (yes, we usually handle meetings on the phone, but I had to be there in person this time).

The article raises the question, have climate scientists overplayed global warming? Various weather events in the past couple of years, the 2005 hurricane season, summer heat waves and the unusual warmth of the early part of this winter in many areas come to mind, have brought a lot more attention to the field of climate study. Some scientists are concerned that the information being presented to the public is being miscommunicated. In particular, some scientists are concerned that the uncertainty that exists within climate science is not being communicated clearly, and that instead the message that gets to the public is a message of absolutes. The article makes it refreshingly clear that there are plenty of elements in the climate which are not understood. Scientists have substantial evidence to support the view that humans are warming the planet - as carbon dioxide levels rise, glaciers melt and global temperatures rise. Yet, for predicting the future climate, scientists must rely upon sophisticated - but not perfect - computer models. \"The public generally underappreciates that climate models are not meant for reducing our uncertainty about future climate, which they really cannot, but rather they are for increasing our confidence that we understand the climate system in general,\" says Michael Bauer, a climate modeler at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in New York. The article concludes by asking if some younger scientists aren't free to contradict older, more established scientists, who may hold sway over the grants needed to fund research.

Conservation biologists are discussing moving species from one location to another to prevent them becoming extinct due to stresses from global warming. Obviously, people have moved species before, repopulating parts of the West with wolves, for instance. The difference in my mind is that in that circumstance, we were returning a species to an area where it had lived and would have continued to live had humans not wiped it out. Moving a species to prevent the possibility that it would not be able to adapt to change and would become extinct without human intervention? I am not aware that we have done that before. We have moved species to help control pests, often with disastrous results. The potential problems this idea raises are numerous - first, what species do you move? Where do you move them? How do you know what impact the species will have on its new home? Will the species have what it needs to thrive in its new location? Will it push out or stress species which are indigenous to the new location? Invasive species have caused great harm around the world, zebra mussels , for example, have damaged the Great Lakes' ecosystem. Conservation biologists aren't planning on moving species soon, but the issue is open for debate. I hope wise decisions are made.

Having grown up in Minnesota, wind is not the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Pennsylvania's weather. The wind is a far more constant companion on the Plains. The wind farms in Pennsylvania are built on the ridges that run from the southwest to the northeast across the state. While they are almost silent, homeowners who live near a wind farm in Somerset County claim the turbines are loud enough at times to keep them awake at night. A more significant ecological issue involves birds, which migrate along the ridges and are sometimes killed by the turbines. The wind farm discussed in the article will generate 50 megawatts of electricity and it will take at least 33 of the 416-foot turbines to produce that much power. Fifty megawatts is enough to provide electricity for 50,000 homes. In comparison, Unit 1 of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant is rated at 850 megawatts. Wind farm output varies by the time of year, and it tends to be lowest in the summer. That's an amazing statistic. It would take over 560 wind turbines to produce as much electricity as Unit 1 of TMI. Wind power may well have a role in our current and future energy picture - the German state of Schleswig-Holstein currently meets one quarter of its energy demand through wind power - but it seems clear that we also need to be looking more closely again at the potential for nuclear power to meet our ever-growing energy demands. France did so after the oil crisis in the 1970s and currently is one of the lowest carbon-emitters in Europe. In my mind, the answer to today's headline question is: No, not THE answer.

Abdusamatov is one of a small number of scientists who dispute the view of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Image courtesy NASA I have a couple of gripes with Abdusamatov's claims in this article. First with this paragraph: He said an examination of ice cores from wells over three kilometers (1.5 miles) deep in Greenland and the Antarctic indicates that the Earth experienced periods of global warming even before the industrial age. I guess they have straw men in Russia, too. I have yet to hear any climate scientist anywhere at any time say there was no pre-industrial global warming. Of course there was! We've had ice ages and interglacial periods. The questions right now are: Is this warming unprecedented? and Are we contributing to it? My second gripe stems from this paragraph: However, Abdusamatov insisted: \"Ascribing 'greenhouse' effect properties to the Earth's atmosphere is not scientifically substantiated. Heated greenhouse gases, which become lighter as a result of expansion, ascend to the atmosphere only to give the absorbed heat away.\" I'd be interested to hear Abdusamatov's explanation for how the Earth is warm enough to sustain life, then. Perhaps there's somewhat of a semantics issue, as a greenhouse is not entirely analogous to the Earth's atmosphere. As one of my favorite greenhouse sites puts it: The name, greenhouse effect is unfortunate, for a real greenhouse does not behave as the atmosphere does. The primary mechanism keeping the air warm in a real greenhouse is the suppression of convection (the exchange of air between the inside and outside). Thus, a real greenhouse does act like a blanket to prevent bubbles of warm air from being carried away from the surface.

First, global warming will be on the ballot in New Hampshire. At least 50 towns will vote by ballot on the New Hampshire Climate Change Resolution, which calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other steps to slow warming. The towns participating use ballot voting rather than Town Meetings . This is a grassroots effort to push global warming as a major issue in the 2008 presidential primaries. Second, I appreciated a piece on Boston.com from Cathy Young on the politicization of the science of global warming. The piece rightly points out that as many on the right are quick to dismiss global warming based on economic motives, many environmentalists are equally quick to believe the worst in order to press for their own agenda. That agenda virtually never includes what may be the easiest current technology to produce electricity without greenhouse emissions, nuclear power. Ms. Young's piece concludes: Most journalists and pundits have limited knowledge of science; as a result, they tend to pick whichever science best suits their political prejudices. Both science and journalism deserve better. Perhaps we can start by remembering that an ideological crusade can be as strong an inducement to bend the truth as the profit motive.

Greenland was explored and named by Erik the Red between 982 and 985 . Most accounts indicate he used the name Greenland to lure settlers from Iceland to join him at this far-flung outpost. Erik and found two areas in the southwest suitable for settlement , with grasslands and small stands of alder and birch. Most of the rest of the island was covered with arctic tundra, snow and ice, much as it is now. Some of Greenland's ice is over three kilometers deep. The first group of settlers - 24 boatloads - set out from Iceland in the summer of 986. Only 14 ships finished the journey, with the other 10 forced to turn back or lost at sea. The Norse colonies grew and prospered for at least the first 200 years in Greenland, with the population peaking at about 5000. Ships from Norway and Iceland visited once or twice a year, and the colonists traded live falcons, polar bear skins, narwahl tusk, walrus ivory and hides for timber, iron, tools and even some luxuries. The Greenlanders had cows, sheep and goats which grazed when the weather permitted but had to be housed in barns during the harsh winter months. As the Medieval Warm Period gave way to the Little Ice Age, Greenlanders kept their livestock in their homes for the added warmth. This was happening as early as the 12th century. As the years passed, the farmland lost its fertility and the cutting of trees for fuel and for the production of charcoal lead to erosion. The Norsemen were stubborn, proud people. They saw themselves as European and continued to pursue a European lifestyle. The Inuit, who also were living in Greenland in the Middle Ages, adapted well to the changing climate. The Norsemen refused to adopt the clothing and hunting gear which allowed the Inuit to thrive, believing the European way to be superior. The last written record from the Greenland Norse colonies dates from 1408. A few Norsemen remained in Greenland into the 16th century. It's fairly clear the Greenlanders lived a hard scrabble life. They were accustomed to hardship. A program on the Little Ice Age from the History Channel mentioned that even during the period of climate optimum, most Europeans had few resources. A failed crop lead to famine. The same must have been true in Greenland. Climate change is not believed to be the sole cause of their demise, but was probably the primary stressor. They had little economic \"cushion\" to fall back on.

I sent an e-mail to Dr. Luke Copland, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Ottawa. Dr. Copland was quoted in the article I linked and he was kind enough to respond. Here's the text of the e-mail: Hi Laura, Thanks for the good question - there have been many breakups of ice shelves across northern Ellesmere Island over the last century so. When these ice shelves were first discovered in about 1900, they were a total of about 10,000 sq km in area. Today they have reduced in size by about 90%, to about 1000 sq km in area. The Ayles Ice Shelf loss was the largest breakup in at least 25 years, but it is part of the long-term trend of loss over the last century. The important point to note with all of these losses is that they are essentially permanent. There is no longer enough glacier ice flowing off the land to replace the ice that is being calved into the ocean. Hence these 3000+ year old shelves are now gone forever. You might also be interested in looking at a media page that we've put together: http://www.geomatics.uottawa.ca/copland/ Regards, Luke Perhaps the loss of these ice shelves is simply due to being in the midst of an interglacial period.

In addition, F1 has the potential to provide the major car manufacturers with an opportunity to develop, showcase and popularise future technologies that will help to reduce the global problem of transport emissions. The article doesn't specify any technologies which will be focused on, but does mention the potential of energy recovery from functions such as braking.

Almost all of North America has had temperatures well above normal so far this winter. I had to look at places in the Rockies to find anyone below normal in the lower 48 - in a quick perusal - and to Alaska to find some significantly cold air. It's 29 below zero (F) as I write this. The normal high is -7. That air will be on the move over the next few days, but won't really drive into the lower 48 as we'd normally see in January. Why? Because we're still dominated by the Pacific jet stream. Arctic air is trapped. And we're not alone. I read an article yesterday which included some recent record warmth in Tibet . An article from NBC news today asks the question \"What's global warming got to do with it?\" While the article does support something of a link between our current weather pattern - as Dr. Stephen Schneider of Stanford University says: \"Whatever the natural causes are, they are riding on top of the warming trend that has been induced by humans using the atmosphere as a free place to dump our tailpipe waste.\" But overwhelmingly, this year's El Niño is blamed for our bizarro-world weather.

As Mike Hulme of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research wrote in a BBC Editorial : The language of fear and terror operates as an ever-weakening vehicle for effective communication or inducement for behavioural change. I was reminded of these things today when I read a piece in The Canadian , which bills itself as \"Canada's new socially progressive and cross-cultural national newspaper.\" The headline grabbed my attention - stating that \" Over 4.5 Billion people could die from Global Warming-related causes by 2012 .\" Pause for a minute. Think about that. The world's current population is a few ticks over 6.5 Billion , so this author is claiming that in a mere 5 years, almost three quarters of the world's population will have succumbed. Heck, if that's the case, I might as well go right down to the GM dealership and buy a Hummer. What difference will that make? A quick read of the article finds it to have some significant holes. First of all, the author is citing a rapid climate warming due to the release of methane caused by the melting of permafrost. This, he says is a \"weeks old\" scientific theory - which is simply not true. I touched on it back in November , referencing a RealClimate.org entry from October, and methane hydrates were also addressed at RealClimate in December of 2005 . The author then goes on to state that methane in the atmosphere oxidizes into atmospheric carbon dioxide (true) which \"lasts for hundreds of thousands of years.\" Oh really? I thought it stayed in the atmosphere 50-200 years . If I gave an award for global warming hysteria, this would be the winner.

First of all, commenter Dion linked Monday's RealClimate entry on El Niño, Global Warming, and Anomalous U.S. Winter Warmth . The folks at RealClimate point out that in an ordinary El Niño winter, the amplitude of warming across the northern half of the U.S. averages about 1 degree C (2F). This year's warming is roughly 5 times that amount. They also point out that last winter was also anomalously warm, despite a weak La Nina. That warmth was most striking in January of 2006. They conclude that it's impossible to determine what role each factor is playing in our current warmth. In reality, the individual roles of deterministic factors such as El Nino, anthropogenic climate change, and of purely random factors (i.e. \"weather\") in the pattern observed thusfar this winter cannot even in principle be ascertained. What we do know, however, is that both anthropogenic climate change and El Nino favor, in a statistical sense, warmer winters over large parts of the U.S. When these factors act constructively, as is the case this winter, warmer temperatures are certainly more likely. Both factors also favor warmer global mean surface temperatures (the warming is one or two tenths of a degree C for a moderate to strong El Nino). It is precisely for this reason that some scientists are already concluding, with some justification, that 2007 stands a good chance of being the warmest year on record for the globe. I also had a commenter raise the question of what effect global warming will have on El Niño. The short answer is we don't know . Some have speculated that El Niño/ENSO events will be more frequent or more intense, but no one knows. For more information, see RealClimate , The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute , and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology .

Now the Union of Concerned Scientists has weighed in with a report summarizing exactly how ExxonMobil has \"manufactured uncertainty\" on climate science. The report, which can be linked from the UCS's homepage, or found directly on ABCnews.com , specifically describes the parallels between Big Tobacco's fight against science from the 1950s to the 1990s and ExxonMobil's ongoing climate science activities, including using some of the same organizations and personel. The report also delineates some of ExxonMobil's lobbying efforts over the past several years. Is UCS a valid source of critcism? Some of called them an \"unlabeled left-wing activist\" group, which means some readers here will reject their findings without even examining the report, while others will embrace it without any critcism. Personally, I think the report did a fairly good job describing (and discrediting) the relatively well known 17,000 signature site and revealing the connection between Tech Central Station and ExxonMobil.

An ice shelf the size of 11,000 football fields broke free from the northern coast of Canada's Ellesmere Island in August of 2005. I'm sure you all know where Ellesmere Island is, right? Yep. North of Greenland. That's it at the very northern extent of this map: We're talking 800 km (slightly less than 500 miles) south of the North Pole. Pretty remote, which is why scientists didn't realize it had happened right away. Scientists have been compiling seismic and satellite data to determine what happened. According to CNN, earthquake monitors 155 miles away picked up the vibrations from the collapse. The remains of the ice shelf are about 15 km long and 5 km wide, and between 30 and 40 meters thick. It could pose a risk to oil platforms along its drift path in the spring. Researchers have not said climate change is to blame for the collapse, but say global warming may have played a role in it.

This is significant because it raises the legal question of whether the government would then be required to legislate restrictions on industrial carbon dioxide emissions. The world has 19 separate polar bear populations, many of which have not been fully assessed. The bears live in Arctic regions in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway and Russia. The bears which are known to be most stressed are those which live around Canada's Hudson Bay. Alaska's polar bear population is also starting to show signs of being stressed, however, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the future of the bear populations. \"This proposal is sort of like a scientific hypothesis. You put this out there and say to the world, 'Tell us, is this right or is this wrong?' \" the official said, adding that Interior will hold several public hearings about its proposal. \"We're projecting what we think will happen in the future, not just what's happening at this moment.\" The proposal could take up to a year to complete.

We've all enjoyed the shade of a tree on a hot summer day, appreciated the beautiful colors of autumn, watched in the spring as the leaves unfold again. Are more trees the answer to sequestering carbon and controlling climate change? Seems the answer to this is more complicated than a simple yes or no. Results of a new study presented at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Society in San Francisco on 15 December indicate that the location of the trees is tremendously important. Govindasamy Bala of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory used computer models to simulate the effects of removing trees from the globe. The models used not only the carbon-storing capacity of trees, but also account for the release of water vapor by the trees (which enhances cloud formation) and the extra heat absorbed from the sun by the foliage which is usually darker than the ground beneath the trees. Read that last one again. Extra heat absorbed - that's a mark against the trees, as it's absorbed heat rather than reflected heat. The results? Trees in the tropics are better at storing carbon than their mid-to-high latitude counterparts; the trees in the extra-tropical regions actually contributed to warming, as the heat they absorb more than counterbalances the CO2 they store. Everyone sees that forests have many other benefits beyond serving as CO2 sinks, but if you are contributing to a reforesting campaign, you may want to consider turning your dollars toward the tropics. Another factor which was not addressed at all within this study is the added benefit of shade trees planted around homes. I would think the energy saved from reducing the need for air conditioning would counterbalance the heat the tree absorbs.

The National Arbor Day Foundation has just released an updated hardiness zone map - the first since 1990. Now, even the most skeptical of the skeptics isn't questioning that the Earth is warming. The questions that remain are how much is due to human activity and how much is due to natural variability. The unseasonable warmth recently in the Northeast can be laid at least partially at the doorstep of El Niño, for example. A peek at the Arbor Day Foundation's animation of the changes in hardiness zones from 1990 to 2006 is pretty dramatic. The warming that has occurred may increase stress on some species of trees, although many will continue to flourish.

There. I said it. There's a raging blizzard in the High Plains and I wish I was there. You know how some meteorologists get all giddy about severe weather? Or hurricanes? That's not me. Me, I like a good winter storm. Like the storm back in the '70s when a big snowfall back home in Minnesota was followed by such brutal winds that the snow was left with a crust an inch thick, and on top of that was a dusting of fine brown powder, like cocoa powder sprinkled on whipped cream. That brown powder was top soil which had blown in from the Dakotas. Amazing. Or the blizzard of '93, when I spent 36 straight hours at AccuWeather, most of it forecasting, all the while watching over 27 inches of snow pile up. And then digging out my car with help from some of my coworkers, then helping others do the same. I love snow. I miss snow. Two days ago, it was 66 degrees in my back yard. Yesterday it was 46.

People can and do lose their lives, mostly in far more mundane circumstances than those that took the life of Kelly James on Mt. Hood . Lots of people are inconvenienced right now because Interstate 70 is closed from Denver to Kansas. Nonetheless, I'm a little jealous of a friend of mine at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, where the most recent observation tells me the visibility is zero in snow and blowing snow, it's 23 degrees and the winds are gusting to near 50 mph.

There is pressure in Europe to adopt more of an American-style business model, but that would result in a 25% increase in energy used, making it much more difficult for those nations which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol to meet their goals. On the flip side, if the U.S. followed the EU-15 in terms of work hours, employed workers would have seven additional weeks off per year (some of this in longer weekends) and the United States would consume 20% less energy.

Right now 58% of our oil comes from other countries, so it?s practically inevitable our foreign policy principles will be held ransom by our need to maintain domestic economic stability. Of course, like anything manmade, even a fully electric car will have an environmental impact. Production and eventually disposal of the batteries will be an issue.

Both of these are examples of something called geoengineering. The Fall 2006 issue of UCAR Quarterly from the National Center for Atmospheric Research has an interesting article on geoengineering which includes more information both of the above plans and also touches on NCAR's own John Latham's ideas on increasing the number of droplets in marine stratocumulus clouds. Latham's research indicates that a 10 % increase in the number of droplets could increase the reflectivity of the clouds enough to counteract as much as a doubling of carbon dioxide. None of these solutions would be used unless the climate was truly teetering on the edge of catastrophe - many scientists have concerns about Crutzen's work, although it underwent peer review, and Angel's plan is massive in scale and expensive. The fact that these ideas are even being considered shows that level of concern the scientific community has over global warming. \"If sizeable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will not happen and temperatures rise rapidly, then climatic engineering . . . is the only option available to rapidly reduce temperature rises and counteract other climatic effects,\" writes Crutzen. He stresses that the technique would be a last-ditch option that \"should not be used to justify inadequate climate policies.\" An invitation-only workshop was held on the subject in November, and a report on that meeting should be out by January.

As I'm sure many of you are aware, corn - from which ethanol is made - is a fairly inefficient source of energy. It's high in starch, which is easy to convert to ethanol, but much of the corn plant's energy goes to producing structural materials such as stalk which are harder to break down. Estimates vary, but the energy output may only be twice the amount of energy it takes to produce the ethanol. The cellulose and hemicellulose which make up the stalks and also make up most biomass which could be converted to ethanol require pretreatment with acids, peroxides and ammonia, often along with mechanical shredding or pressing of the material. Following that step comes the use of enzymes to produce fermentable sugars. Interestingly, one of the companies concentrating on these enzymes got it's start distressing denim for jeans. Some other plants, including a variety of prairie grasses, may be more energy-rich than corn. A number of researchers are studying the viability of these other resources. The article wraps up with a brief discussion of butanol as an alternative to ethanol. Ethanol is corrosive, volatile and has a tendency to pick up water, making it difficult to transport. Butanol is a four-carbon alcohol which contains a higher energy per gallon than ethanol and can be shipped through existing pipelines. The large companies who are working on these biofuels have some pretty familiar names - BP and DuPont are working with British Sugar to adapt an ethanol fermentation facility in East Anglia to produce Butanol. And BP has announced it will invest $500 million over 10 years to fund an Energy Biosciences Institute at a major academic center.

It seems to me that better examples of potential future threats could have been used. We've already discussed the \"fiercer hurricanes\" controversy - will they, won't they? No one really knows.

Rockefeller IV and Olympia Snowe sent a letter to ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson asking the oil giant to cease funding of climate change \"deniers.\" Heck, there's an entire web site focussed on \"outing\" ExxonMobil's funding of climate change skeptics . The Wall Street Journal, which has a bit of a skeptical bent on the global warming issue, comments extensively on the senators' letter. I've got mixed feelings on this. First of all, the $19 million dollars spent by ExxonMobil since the late 1990s (7 or 8 years) seems to be a relative pittance, especially given the monstrous profits the company has generated in recent years.

Of course, it's always best to trust peer-reviewed science over research which hasn't come under the same scrutiny, but is peer review always fair? An April, 2006 editorial in the Wall Street Journal from Richard Lindzen , Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Atmospheric Science at MIT, included this paragraph expressing his own frustration at the peer review process: And then there are the peculiar standards in place in scientific journals for articles submitted by those who raise questions about accepted climate wisdom. At Science and Nature, such papers are commonly refused without review as being without interest. However, even when such papers are published, standards shift. When I, with some colleagues at NASA, attempted to determine how clouds behave under varying temperatures, we discovered what we called an \"Iris Effect,\" wherein upper-level cirrus clouds contracted with increased temperature, providing a very strong negative climate feedback sufficient to greatly reduce the response to increasing CO2. Normally, criticism of papers appears in the form of letters to the journal to which the original authors can respond immediately. However, in this case (and others) a flurry of hastily prepared papers appeared, claiming errors in our study, with our responses delayed months and longer. The delay permitted our paper to be commonly referred to as \"discredited.\" Indeed, there is a strange reluctance to actually find out how climate really behaves. In 2003, when the draft of the U.S. National Climate Plan urged a high priority for improving our knowledge of climate sensitivity, the National Research Council instead urged support to look at the impacts of the warming--not whether it would actually happen. Mr. Lindzen is criticized by some for taking consulting fees from oil and gas interests.

Two I've seen recently - Little Ice Age: Big Chill , a two-hour show from the History Channel on the period from roughly 1300 to 1850 and Naked Science: Big Freeze on the National Geographic Channel. This one's about possible causes for the next ice-age and will be broadcast again at 6:00 p.m. (eastern) Friday. Both of these programs were really interesting, and I'd encourage anyone to check them out. The History Channel program covers some points which have been brought up by my readers in their comments and e-mails - the Frost Fairs in London, held on the River Thames in those years when it was cold enough that the river froze to an extent that the events could occur and the collapse of the Norse colonies in Greenland . I'd encourage people to read that link on the Greenlanders, it's fascinating. The History Channel program also discusses other impacts of the Little Ice Age, including that people at that time were living pretty marginal lives when the weather was good. When the weather was bad, famine quickly became widespread, weakening the population and making people more susceptible to disease. Famine also led to political unrest, including factoring into the French Revolution. Naked Science: Big Freeze was similar in content to the MegaDisasters: Mega Freeze program I commented on back in November. It discussed current climate, the fact that our current, stable climate is not typical over the planet's history, and what could cause climate change. Again, it touched on the collapse of the Thermohaline circulation due to a deluge of fresh water from ice melt. What I found myself wondering is this: I've had my DVR set to search for programs on climate and global warming for the past 4 months, and aside from the Tom Brokaw Global Warming, What You Need to Know special, there have been precious few programs on what warming will mean for the planet. Why has global cooling garnered more attention? The obvious answer of course is that producers make TV programs they think people will want to watch. Ice is just so spellbinding.

One article is about ethanol production in Brazil . Brazillians use sugar cane to produce ethanol, a crop which yields far more energy than the corn we in the United States use. Most cars in Brazil are flex-fuel vehicles which run either on pure ethanol or on an ethanol/gasoline mix. The country produced 282,000 barrels of ethanol a day in 2005 - 40% of the fuel operating Brazil's cars. Ethanol makes sense from a carbon standpoint because unlike fossil fuels, which take carbon which has been buried for millions of years and releases it into the atmosphere, it takes carbon which was in the atmosphere just a couple of years ago - effectively no net emissions. Ah....I can hear my readers saying.....but how much energy does it take to produce the ethanol? You've got fertilizer, farm equipment, fermentation and distillation....a lot of inputs. A study was done in 2004 which compared the inputs versus the outputs, both in ethanol and in surplus electricity added to the power grid from burning the fibrous pulp leftover from the cane itself, and the output totaled eight times as much energy as the inputs. Sugar cane cannot be farmed in areas of cleared rain forest, as it is a crop which requires a dry season. There is some concern that as sugar cane growing expands, some of Brazil's other agriculture will move into areas of cleared rain forest.

I can remember vividly as my professor picked up a globe and set it on his desk. He said that if the dome of the Wisconsin State Capitol building - almost a mile away - were the sun, then the globe on his desk was approximately the correct size and distance from the sun to represent the Earth. He then took a single sheet of paper and laid it on the globe. \"And this,\" he said, \"is the atmosphere.\" I tell this story for two reasons. First, Al Gore (seen here visiting Glacier National Park) tells a similar story in An Inconvenient Truth , paraphrasing Carl Sagan saying if you have an old globe, the layer of varnish on it is comparable in thickness to the Earth's atmosphere. Second, Mr. Gore clearly had a fairly similar experience sitting in geochemist Roger Revelle's classroom at Harvard in 1968. Dr. Revelle had started doing research on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and he had already seen the upward trend, year by year, and he was convinced that warming would follow. This clearly made a big impression on Mr. Gore and as he has seen evidence of warming since that time, is something he has become passionate about. I thought the movie did a pretty good job of presenting the science in a way non-scientists can understand. There were a couple of things that were a little shaky - I thought he hit the hurricane/global warming connection a little too hard, as that's really still a topic being debated. Being that the movie was made in the wake of Katrina, it is understandable. Given the way the 2006 season turned out, it lacks some punch. His related points on how vulnerable society is and the impact of potentially many times as many refugees as those produced by Katrina were well made. RealClimate addresses a couple of more minor scientific errors here . I thought the movie made too much of the political side of the issue, and that in playing that up, it would be more divisive than it could/should have been. On the other hand, my husband watched the movie and said it was LESS political than he expected - by far - and he's a pretty conservative guy. Bottom line - if you have a strong opinion on global warming, An Inconvenient Truth probably will not change your mind. But I believe it's worth watching, if only to continue to fuel discussion.

In the case of Massachusetts v. EPA, Massachusetts and several other states are attempting to force the EPA to regulate the greenhouse gases emitted by vehicles in the United States. Vehicles in the U.S. emit approximately 6 percent of global annual GHG emissions. The CAA does mention carbon dioxide specifically, but it does not in this portion of the statute (emphasis mine), give the EPA the right to regulate it. (g) Pollution Prevention and Emissions Control.- In carrying out subsection (a), the Administrator shall conduct a basic engineering research and technology program to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate non regulatory strategies and technologies for air pollution prevention. Such strategies and technologies shall be developed with priority on those pollutants which pose a significant risk to human health and the environment, and with opportunities for participation by industry, public interest groups, scientists, and other interested persons in the development of such strategies and technologies. Such program shall include the following elements: (1) Improvements in nonregulatory strategies and technolo- gies for preventing or reducing multiple air pollutants, including sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, heavy metals, PM- 10 (particulate matter), carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide , from stationary sources, including fossil fuel power plants. Such strategies and technologies shall include improvements in the relative cost effectiveness and long-range implications of various air pollutant reduction and nonregulatory control strategies such as energy conservation, including end-use efficiency, and fuel- switching to cleaner fuels. Such strategies and technologies shall be considered for existing and new facilities. There are other portions of the statute which make it relatively clear that if a substance is determined to be a pollutant which has an adverse effect on human health or the environment , then the EPA has the authority to regulate it. The sticking point here is that the EPA has done nothing toward that determination. This suit clearly is an attempt to push the EPA forward.

Of course, this is a mere 50-some pages of testimony. Not even close to the written materials provided the court, I'm sure. It's pretty clear that none of the participants are scientists, and it's equally clear that I am not a lawyer - some of the context is lost on me because I know nothing of the cases which each side cites in their support. As I said in my last entry, the point of the case before the Supreme Court is to try to get the EPA to regulate GHG emissions from vehicles. The best they can hope for is to lower the emissions from the current 6 percent of the global total to 3.5 percent of the current global total emissions. Unfortunately, by the time the current fleet of vehicles would turnover, the amount of growth in emissions from other sectors and certainly from other nations would completely overwhelm that small amount of savings. And even if other emissions didn't change, it's not enough of an impact to make a difference. Massachusetts is claiming that it's being damaged by global warming - that sea level rises will engulf a large portion of it's coastline (bye bye, Cape Cod) and that's the standing for their suit.

Still other scientists say that because it is the difference between air temperature and water temperature which fuels stronger storms, stronger storms would not necessarily result from global warming. The article also points out that it's important not to just look at storms in the Atlantic, but to look at tropical activity throughout the world's oceans. Judith Curry, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta said the rest of the world's oceans were more active this year. In my opinion, we don't have enough years of accurate hurricane information to say much about trends in numbers or in intensity of storms. Prior to the satellite age, there were storms which formed and dissipated over the oceans without ever being counted. And as for the current age, no one would care if there were 20 category 5 storms in a year if none of them made landfall. The single most important paragraph in this story is the last - a quote from Florida State University meteorology professor James O'Brien: \"We still have 1,000 people a day coming to Florida, and they want to live near the water,\" he said. \"So we need to be prepared.\" As long as the population continues to migrate toward our vulnerable coastlines, and to bring a lot of wealth with it - building expensive homes, etc. - our risk for large-scale disaster continues to increase, no matter whether hurricanes are becoming more intense or not.

Here is a map to get you acclimated with the scene. The men are staying at McMurdo Station, which is located near the coast along the bottom of this image (tempting to say southern coast, but that would not be accurate!). McMurdo is located right at the rim of the Texas-size Ross Ice Shelf. That ice shelf sits over the water and helps to hold back the ice which is over land on Antarctica. If it were to break away from the continent, some of the ice on land would slip into the sea as well.

I'm no lawyer, and while I understand the basics of the case, I knew there were a lot of subtleties I was missing. So today I found a commentary from Michael C. Dorf which clarifies some of the legal jargon. In particular, it does a really good job explaining the standing doctrine, which comes out of Article III of the Constitution. Here's a paragraph that summarizes the standing rules: The standing rules that the Supreme Court has located in the case-or-controversy requirement are complex, but three requirements stand out as particularly strange in a case like Massachusetts v. EPA . The plaintiff must show: first, that the injury alleged by the plaintiff is imminent; second, that the alleged injury is \"concrete and particularized,\" rather than a \"generalized grievance;\" and third, that it is \"likely,\" rather than merely \"speculative,\" that the alleged injury will be redressed by a favorable judgment.

Instead, I'm writing about the stem cell \"research\" of a South Korean scientist named Hwang Woo-Suk, which was published in the prestigious journal Science in two separate articles, one in 2004, the other in 2005. Turned out Hwang's claims of a breakthrough in stem cell technology was completely bogus - a deliberate fraud. In 2005, Science published about 8 percent of the 12,000 studies submitted; studies in subjects from microbiology to astronomy. The journal previously had based its procedures on the assumption that the papers it receives are \" honestly conceived and written. \" Following the fraud of Hwang, new procedures are being implemented at the journal, although the editors of Science recognize the difficulty in evaluating papers which claim \"major breakthroughs.\" The new procedures will include a required \"risk assessment\" for each paper and requiring more extensive information in the published supporting material. An interesting quote from the report from the committee examining Science 's peer review process is as follows: Science (and Nature ) have reached a special status. Publication in Science has a significance that goes beyond that of 'normal' publication. Consequently, the value to some authors of publishing in Science , including enhanced reputation, visibility, position or cash rewards, is sufficiently high that some may not adhere to the usual scientific standards in order to achieve publication. Thus, the cachet of publishing in Science can be an incentive not to follow the rules. This problem has a significant impact on all of science, since trust in the system is essential, and since Science and Nature are seen to speak for the best in science. Furthermore, false information in the literature leads to an enormous waste of time and money in an effort to correct and clarify the science. The only reference to climate change is here (emphasis mine): Papers in this class, particularly those that will receive public attention, can influence public policy or contribute to personal or institutional financial gain and thus warrant special scrutiny. In the immediate future, examples will likely come from the areas of climate change , human health, and particular issues in commercial biomedicine and nanotechnology. My point in this entry is not to criticize Science or Nature , two of the finest journals we have. Rather it is to say that if fraud can occur, even with the added security layer of peer review, how easy is it to create a web site that looks legitimate, include equations and a few obscure references, call it science and fool the public?

The title was actually a little misleading, as the only parts of the world heading for a Mega Freeze were the mid- to upper-latitudes. The rest of the world was dealing with Mega Heat, Mega Floods and Mega Droughts. I guess Mega Climate Meltdown was too cumbersome a name. The point of the program was that global warming may cause too much ice melt which will cause too much \"freshening\" of the sea water which will shut down at least a portion of the Thermohaline circulation. The Thermohaline circulation is a broad ocean circulation which acts to transport heat from the equatorial region toward the poles. If it were to shut down, or at least if the northern extent of it were shut down, places like western Europe, eastern Canada and the northeastern part of the United States would turn sharply colder. Here's a simple graphic of the Thermohaline circulation, from NOAA's web site: This idea has been creeping into the media, with articles such as this one from the UK Guardian. However, at this point there seems to be little to be concerned about, and in fact RealClimate.org effectively argues that the article in the Guardian was groundless. The program on the History Channel did make some fairly strong correlations between past climate change and periods of societal unrest which made for interesting viewing.

Speaking of extinctions - here's an interesting article I found on MSNBC.com today about some new research on what happened in the oceans following a mass extinction 250 million years ago.

First is Sharp , which has a strategy in place to become a \"Zero Impact\" brand in terms of global warming by 2010. They are doing this through a variety of means, including operating Super Green factories, powered independently of the utility power grid through a combination of energy sources such as photovoltaics and fuel-cells. I find it ironic that Sharp has aggressive marketing plans for its Thin-Film solar modules in the Middle East. Not that it doesn't make sense, given the region's abundant sunshine. Second is Google . Which announced in October that it would be using 9,200 solar cells to help power its one-million-square-foot office complex in Mountain View, California. The system should provide 30 percent of the office's electricity; on any day the system provides more power than it needs, that electricity would be sold to Pacific Gas & Electric. One interesting quote from the article: He said the solar power system, in addition to paying for itself over time, would be socially responsible and would help attract smart, high-level engineers who wanted to work for a company trying to diminish the damage it does to the environment. This concurs with some other things I've read and heard recently about green companies. Being green is a big draw for employees - both for new hires and for maintaining employee loyalty.

Cap and trade, to summarize again, is the policy in which a GHG emitter is \"capped\" at a set value of emissions and that if they exceed that value, they must trade with an emitter who is under their set value. This value can be gradually decreased in order to ease back on overall emissions. This method worked effectively in reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution from existing power plants in the United States, which helped to curb acid rain. However, trying to manage a cap-and-trade system on a global scale would be nightmarish in it's complexity. This article argues that a better solution is to set performance standards, not on existing emitters but on new sources. Save the expensive retrofits on coal-fired power plants, but any new coal burners (and there will be a LOT of them!) would have to meet stringent CO2 emission requirements. I'll be writing more later on how coal plants can almost eliminate emissions. The same idea would work for automobiles, appliances, etc. Performance standards set in the 1970s vastly improved air quality, both by reducing emissions from power plants and from autos. The Montreal Protocol set global standards for phasing out the production of CFCs and is solving the global ozone-layer problem. I believe there are opportunities for vast improvements on our CO2 emissions, and that some people are going to get very, very wealthy due to their innovations.

What could be a better topic for today? I wish I knew, because methane is one of the most difficult topics around when it comes to greenhouse gases. Well, first the good news. A new study, summarized here , finds that atmospheric methane has stabilized, possibly due to leak repairs at oil and gas pipelines and storage facilities and perhaps from reduced or slower growth of emissions from coal mining, natural gas production and rice paddies. Methane is also released into the atmosphere by a number of natural phenomena, such as biomass burning, volcanic eruptions and the melting of methane hydrates in permafrost. Oh, and it also results from cows - as Henry noted in a November 6th entry on his MeteoMadness blog. The fact that methane is currently stable in the atmosphere is a good thing, but this entry at RealClimate.org makes it fairly clear that our understanding of methane variations is limited, to say the least. We simply can not use the data we have now to construct any sort of accurate forecast for future methane concentrations. Given that methane is a more potent (though shorter-lived) greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, and given that methane in the atmosphere oxides into carbon dioxide, this is another area where more research is needed.

While the group's home page makes their political leanings clear, and I don't advocate any political party or affiliation, I do appreciate some of what the report has to say about making homes more energy efficient. The report is too bold, in my opinion, in many of it's statements on global warming. Vermont has many older (pre-1940) homes with poor insulation and older home heating equipment. New furnaces are as much as 40% more efficient than models which are over 15 years old. In addition, improving weatherization and insulation of a home - which can cost a couple of thousand dollars but will generally pay for itself within 4 years, according to the report - can also reduce the burden on the state, as lower-income families may require less assistance to pay their heating bills. Since the cost of heating oil - one of the most common sources of heat in the Northeast - has skyrocketed in the last 7 years, more families than ever before are requiring assistance to pay their heating bills. I know from personal experience that upgrading a furnace in an older home can have a dramatic effect on fuel oil consumption. Our previous home was built in 1945, and when we moved in, it had the original furnace. The thing ran like a champ, but it was tremendously inefficient. When we upgraded, we found we used at least one third less fuel oil than we had used before. Some weatherization is expensive, such as replacement windows, and some, such as blocking drafts through electrical outlets on outside walls, is not.

As seems fitting for the location, much of the conference seems to have dealt with how global warming has and will impact the world's poorest nations, particularly those in Africa. Here's a summary of the agreements reached so far and also of the unresolved issues. Poor countries want rich countries to take more action on reducing GHGs. Many of the nations who signed Kyoto are not on track to meet their goals. And rich nations don't want to hamstring themselves economically by setting their own goals dramatically higher than other industrial nations. I especially liked this quote from a Reuters article : \"Sometimes it's not easy to solve problems among the three parties in government (in Germany),\" German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel said. \"Here you have 189 (nations) and its difficult to find solutions.\" U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan put the blame for global warming on a \"frightening lack of leadership\" but later insisted he was not singling out the United States, according to the . Perhaps poor nations should also take action to reduce their impacts on climate change, not through GHG emissions, but through land use changes. I should have more on that later!

That means I've spent WAY too much time looking at computer models. I'm enough of an old-timer to remember the baroclinic and the LFM, though of course I have had much more experience with the NGM, the ETA (NAM, WRF, whatever they're calling it this week) and the longer range models like the European and the GFS. Those years of experience have taught me two things. First, computer models have glaring weaknesses. Some would say they stink. Some would say worse. There is just so much complexity in the atmosphere which has to be simplified for the sake of number-crunching time that they can't capture everything that happens. And sometimes that results in massive error. Second, meteorologists can't function without them. While I still think you get more accuracy in the first 6-12 hours of a forecast by looking at the NOW - satellites, radar, surface and upper level charts - the models are better than \"classical methods\" farther out. So it's sort of a love-hate relationship. Climate models are really a different animal from weather forecasting models, but it's difficult for my forecaster brain to get away from my feeling that models are not entirely to be trusted. Nonetheless, models are one of the primary methods climate scientists use to predict climate change. Here's an excellent of what climate models are and how they work from Gavin Schmidt, a climate modeller at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Now if you really want to have fun.....and you have a half-way decent PC (or Mac) that can be pretty much dedicated to a project for a couple of days, you too can become a climate modeller! Columbia University has an educational Global Climate Model which uses NASA GISS' GCM II but can be run on a desktop. This software was developed for use with students from 9th grade through grad school. Any teachers reading this may be interested in using this tool in their classrooms. Just a couple of notes on this model, I downloaded it a couple of weeks ago on a Friday and ran it on my rather elderly, 400 MHz processor Mac. It ran like a top - no problems with it even though I had to work a rare forecasting shift on Saturday and I had multiple applications running with the GCM in the background. However, it took from Friday evening to midday Monday to run a 50 year simulation. I would love to see what I could do running this on a newer system with something near 2 GHz processing speed. There are a bunch of simulations which can be run if you've got the speed to do it.

There's a new study from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research out of the UK's Met Office which warns that drought could double or more by the end of the century. And that's the figure for moderate drought. Extreme drought could increase 10-fold, from 3 percent to 30 percent of the Earth's land surface, and severe drought could increase from 8 percent to 40 percent of land. Moderate drought currently affects 25 percent of Earth's land surface, and that is forecast to increase to 50 percent. If you are a subscriber to the American Meteorological Society's Journals Online, you can read about this study here . Increased drought will mean increased wildfires, and this fire season has been the most severe on record in the western states.

First of all, it's important to note that the greenhouse effect and global warming are NOT the same thing. Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect have always been with us, and in fact makes the Earth habitable. If the Earth had no atmosphere, it would average about 30 degrees Celsius (about 50 degrees Farenheit) lower than it does at present. (Image From Global Warming Art) So how does the atmosphere help keep the Earth warm? Most of the sun's radiation has a short wavelength. It's mostly in and near the visible parts of the spectrum. The atmosphere is mostly transparent to visible light, which is absorbed by the Earth's surface. As the surface warms, it radiates longer wavelength radiation which warms the atmosphere. Those areas which receive more sunlight warm the most, and land warms much faster than water. And of course, some surfaces on the land absorb more of the sun's radiation and heat up faster, as anyone who has walked from a grassy park onto an asphalt parking lot on a hot July afternoon knows. The radiation absorbed by the atmosphere is then emitted in all directions, some going back to Earth, some going out to space. This whole process is complicated further by the presence of clouds, which can reflect some of the incoming solar radiation and can also prevent the day's heating from escaping back to space at night. Greenhouse gases include water vapor (the most abundant by far), carbon dioxide and methane. The concern among many climate scientists is that increasing amounts of CO2 will increase the overall global temperature (global warming) and have a damaging effect on the Earth's climate.

What is the ideal temperature? Should it ever change? The response to question number 1, Jim, is absolutely! The entire history of the globe is a history of climate change. Ice ages, periods of near tropical conditions in the mid-latitudes. It's all happened before, for a variety of reasons. Many, but not all, climate scientists believe that much of the warming over the past few decades has been caused by human activity, both through emission of greenhouse gases and because of land-use changes. As for your second question, I would think we're fairly close to that now, as far as humans are concerned. The warming of the past few decades has mostly been seen in a decrease in the diurnal (day to night) temperature range. That is, nights have not been as cool, which has resulted in a lengthened growing season in some areas. I think this is mostly the case in the mid-latitudes and people in other parts of the world may disagree.

My name is Laura Hannon, and I've been a forecast meteorologist with Accu-Weather....er.... AccuWeather.....er.... AccuWeather.com for 19 years. Lots has changed in that time. Why, when I first walked in the door, I was greeted by the sound of about twenty clattering IBM Selectrics (that's typewriters for you young'uns). Now, a huge percentage of our business is online. Unlike many of my colleagues, I am not an alumnae of Penn State. I attended the great State University of Wisconsin, and am a proud, vociferous Badger fan. Another fact that sets me apart from many of my coworkers is that I don't live or work in State College anymore. Like Ken Clark (the trailblazer), I am a telecommuter. I live on Harrisburg's West Shore with my husband and soon-to-be 5 year old twin daughters. Although I've been in the weather business for a long time, I've mostly tried to stay out of the global warming debate. I'm not an expert on climate, nor will I pretend to be one. My opinion going back 15 years has always been not so much an opinion as a question. \"Do we know enough?\" Do we know enough to say that the changes that are occurring are exclusively as a result of human activity? Do we know enough to determine what actions need to be taken? Do we know enough about the interaction between the oceans and the atmosphere? Do we understand the atmosphere and climate change well enough to create accurate climate models? I've been doing a ton of reading since taking on this assignment for AccuWeather.com, and if anything I have more questions now than I did when I began. It is up to science, not politicians or special interest groups, to come up with the answers. Many people, and most journalists, don't have a strong background in science, which adds a layer of complexity to the issue of global warming. People want simple answers, and this is quite honestly not a simple issue. My goal is to act as a bridge between hard science and ordinary people, to try to make the difficult issues easier to understand. In our culture today, it's hard to have a civilized discourse on any even remotely controversial subject. And without question, global warming is a controversial subject. Nonetheless, the goal of this site is to present information on global warming from all sides. I will sift through the boatloads of information on global warming available on the Web and in the media and bring you information that will be useful and meaningful in your lives. Please, feel free to post comments and ask questions. It may take me some time to get to them, but it's my promise to you that I will read everything you bring to the table.

Though this is an economic forecast, it contains quite a lot of climate science as well. You can read an AP report on the review here and find the review itself, along with the press release and some other materials here . I will make no guarantee that I will slog through the full 700 page report, but I have found some interesting commentary on the review by people who have read it. I'll point you to a couple of entries at Prometheus: The Science Policy Weblog , specifically the entries from October 29, 30 and 31. Richard Tol's comment (downloadable as a Word document) is particularly critical of the conclusions of the Stern Review.

Yes, according to this article from the Toronto Daily News, governments and companies may face law suits for their role in global warming. I've already seen global warming skeptics compared with people who claimed cigarettes weren't harmful to health, but this is a new twist.

Some feedbacks are positive- they amplify warming, and some are negative - they suppress warming. Let's take a quick look at a graphic showing how cold air is made. Basically, what this graphic is showing us is that at this time of the year, when the Arctic is receiving little sunlight, the radiative input is less than the radiative output. In other words, more energy leaves the Earth than is added by the sun and cooling occurs. In addition to that part of the equation, the radiative output (energy lost) is increased by the snow and ice on the ground. Anyone who has experienced snow knows how well it reflects light. It is possible to become \"snowblind\" from exposure to the bright sunlight and UV rays reflected by the snow. You see, it's not just the light that is reflected by snow, it is also the other portions of the sun's energy, including it's heat that is reflected away from the Earth's surface. So what does this have to do with global warming? You have probably heard about concerns over the diminishing ice in Greenland and elsewhere in the Arctic as well as in Antarctica. In areas where the ice melts, revealing land or ocean beneath it, less of the sun's heat is reflected back to space and more is absorbed. Since it is the sun's energy absorbed by the Earth that warms the atmosphere, the melting ice can become a positive feedback and cause the Earth to warm faster.

Many people are concerned about the impact that they are having on the environment. Perhaps they are interested in how to their carbon footprint. (Note: This is not an endorsement of NativeEnergy.) And maybe they'd like to know what actions they can take to reduce their carbon footprint. I've heard a statistic in a couple of places and found it here . If every household in the U.S. would replace one light bulb with an Energy Star qualified compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL), it would prevent greenhouse gases equivalent to the emissions of 800,000 cars. CFLs use 66% less energy than a standard incandescent bulb and last up to 10 times longer. Reminds me of that commercial with the guy who says, \"It feels good to save the cash....er.....planet.\" By the way, if you zip on over to the energystar.gov site, you can take an interesting quiz on energy star lighting. I got 8 out of 10 without reading all their supporting material first - go ahead and beat me.
